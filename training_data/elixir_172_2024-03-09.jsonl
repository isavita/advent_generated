After ten seconds, Comet has gone 140 km, while Dancer has gone 160 km. On the eleventh second, Comet begins resting (staying at 140 km), and Dancer continues on for a total distance of 176 km.

Santa is booting up his weather machine; looks like you might get a white Christmas after all.\n\nThe weather machine beeps! On the console of the machine is a copy protection message asking you to enter a code from the instruction manual. Apparently, it refuses to run unless you give it that code. No problem; you'll just look up the code in the--\n\n\"Ho ho ho\", Santa ponders aloud. \"I can't seem to find the manual.\"\n\nYou look up the support number for the manufacturer and give them a call. Good thing, too - that 49th star wasn't going to earn itself.\n\n\"Oh, that machine is quite old!\", they tell you. \"That model went out of support six minutes ago, and we just finished shredding all of the manuals. I bet we can find you the code generation algorithm, though.\"\n\nAfter putting you on hold for twenty minutes (your call is very important to them, it reminded you repeatedly), they finally find an engineer that remembers how the code system works.\n\nThe codes are printed on an infinite sheet of paper, starting in the top-left corner. The codes are filled in by diagonals: starting with the first row with an empty first box, the codes are filled in diagonally up and to the right. This process repeats until the infinite paper is covered. So, the first few codes are filled in in this order:\n\n   | 1   2   3   4   5   6  \n---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n 1 |  1   3   6  10  15  21\n 2 |  2   5   9  14  20\n 3 |  4   8  13  19\n 4 |  7  12  18\n 5 | 11  17\n 6 | 16\nFor example, the 12th code would be written to row 4, column 2; the 15th code would be written to row 1, column 5.\n\nThe voice on the other end of the phone continues with how the codes are actually generated. The first code is 20151125. After that, each code is generated by taking the previous one, multiplying it by 252533, and then keeping the remainder from dividing that value by 33554393.\n\nSo, to find the second code (which ends up in row 2, column 1), start with the previous value, 20151125. Multiply it by 252533 to get 5088824049625. Then, divide that by 33554393, which leaves a remainder of 31916031. That remainder is the second code.\n\n\"Oh!\", says the voice. \"It looks like we missed a scrap from one of the manuals. Let me read it to you.\" You write down his numbers:\n\n   |    1         2         3         4         5         6\n---+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\n 1 | 20151125  18749137  17289845  30943339  10071777  33511524\n 2 | 31916031  21629792  16929656   7726640  15514188   4041754\n 3 | 16080970   8057251   1601130   7981243  11661866  16474243\n 4 | 24592653  32451966  21345942   9380097  10600672  31527494\n 5 |    77061  17552253  28094349   6899651   9250759  31663883\n 6 | 33071741   6796745  25397450  24659492   1534922  27995004\n\"Now remember\", the voice continues, \"that's not even all of the first few numbers; for example, you're missing the one at 7,1 that would come before 6,2.

Clearly unimpressed by the last version (in what movie is the password decrypted in order?!), the Easter Bunny engineers have worked out a better solution.\n\nInstead of simply filling in the password from left to right, the hash now also indicates the position within the password to fill.

In this configuration, bot number 2 is responsible for comparing value-5 microchips with value-2 microchips.\n\nBased on your instructions, what is the number of the bot that is responsible for comparing value-61 microchips with value-17 microchips?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 56.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nWhat do you get if you multiply together the values of one chip in each of outputs 0, 1, and 2?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule Task do\n  def iterate(list), do: iterate(list, [])\n  def iterate([], result), do: result\n  def iterate([head | tail], result) do\n    iterate(tail, [parse(head) | result])\n  end\n\n  def parse(\"value \" <> string) do\n    [_, v, b] = Regex.run(~r/(\\d+) goes to bot (\\d+)/, string)\n    {String.to_atom(b), String.to_integer(v)}\n  end\n  def parse(\"bot \" <> string) do\n    [_, b, l, h] = Regex.run(~r/(\\d+) gives low to (.*) and high to (.*)/, string)\n    {String.to_atom(b), type(l), type(h)}\n  end\n\n  def execute(list), do: execute(list, 1, [], [])\n  def execute([], result, [], _store), do: result\n  def execute([], result, missed, store), do: execute(missed, result, [], store)\n  def execute([head | tail], result, missed, store) do\n    {result, missed, store} = run(head, result, missed, store)\n    execute(tail, result, missed, store)\n  end\n\n  def run({b, v}, result, missed, store) do\n    {result, store} = put_value({:b, b}, v, result, store)\n    {result, missed, store}\n  end\n  def run({b, l, h}, result, missed, store) do\n    key = Keyword.get(store, b)\n    move({b, l, h}, result, missed, store, key)\n  end\n\n  def put_value({:b, b}, v, result, store) do\n    old = Keyword.get(store, b) || {}\n    new = insert(old, v)\n    store = Keyword.put(store, b, new)\n    {result, store}\n  end\n  def put_value({:o, o}, v, result, store) do\n    if (Enum.member?([:\"0\", :\"1\", :\"2\"], o)) do\n      result = result * v\n    end\n    {result, store}\n  end\n\n  def move({b, l, h}, result, missed, store, {v1, v2} = items) do\n    store = Keyword.delete(store, b)\n    {result, store} = put_value(h, v2, result, store)\n    {result, store} = put_value(l, v1, result, store)\n    {result, missed, store}\n  end\n  def move(operation, result, missed, store, _), do: {result, [operation | missed], store}\n\n  def insert({}, v), do: {v}\n  def insert({e}, v) when e > v, do: {v, e}\n  def insert({e}, v) when e < v, do: {e, v}\n\n  def type(\"bot \" <> b), do: {:b, String.to_atom(b)}\n  def type(\"output \" <> o), do: {:o, String.to_atom(o)}\n\n  def calculate(input) do\n    input\n      |> String.split(\"\\n\")\n      |> List.delete_at(-1)\n      |> iterate\n      |> execute\n  end\nend\n\n{:ok, input} = File.read(\"input.txt\")\nresult = Task.calculate(input)\nIO.inspect result\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

There are some radiation warnings and a big sign which reads \"Radioisotope Testing Facility\".\n\nAccording to the project status board, this facility is currently being used to experiment with Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs, or simply \"generators\") that are designed to be paired with specially-constructed microchips. Basically, an RTG is a highly radioactive rock that generates electricity through heat.\n\nThe experimental RTGs have poor radiation containment, so they're dangerously radioactive. The chips are prototypes and don't have normal radiation shielding, but they do have the ability to generate an electromagnetic radiation shield when powered. Unfortunately, they can only be powered by their corresponding RTG. An RTG powering a microchip is still dangerous to other microchips.\n\nIn other words, if a chip is ever left in the same area as another RTG, and it's not connected to its own RTG, the chip will be fried. Therefore, it is assumed that you will follow procedure and keep chips connected to their corresponding RTG when they're in the same room, and away from other RTGs otherwise.\n\nThese microchips sound very interesting and useful to your current activities, and you'd like to try to retrieve them. The fourth floor of the facility has an assembling machine which can make a self-contained, shielded computer for you to take with you - that is, if you can bring it all of the RTGs and microchips.\n\nWithin the radiation-shielded part of the facility (in which it's safe to have these pre-assembly RTGs), there is an elevator that can move between the four floors. Its capacity rating means it can carry at most yourself and two RTGs or microchips in any combination. (They're rigged to some heavy diagnostic equipment - the assembling machine will detach it for you.) As a security measure, the elevator will only function if it contains at least one RTG or microchip. The elevator always stops on each floor to recharge, and this takes long enough that the items within it and the items on that floor can irradiate each other. (You can prevent this if a Microchip and its Generator end up on the same floor in this way, as they can be connected while the elevator is recharging.)\n\nYou make some notes of the locations of each component of interest (your puzzle input). Before you don a hazmat suit and start moving things around, you'd like to have an idea of what you need to do.\n\nWhen you enter the containment area, you and the elevator will start on the first floor.\n\nFor example, suppose the isolated area has the following arrangement:\n\nThe first floor contains a hydrogen-compatible microchip and a lithium-compatible microchip.\nThe second floor contains a hydrogen generator.\nThe third floor contains a lithium generator.\nThe fourth floor contains nothing relevant.\nAs a diagram (F# for a Floor number, E for Elevator, H for Hydrogen, L for Lithium, M for Microchip, and G for Generator), the initial state looks like this:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 .  .  .

You need to overwrite some disks with random-looking data to cover your tracks and update the local security system with a new checksum for those disks.\n\nFor the data to not be suspicious, it needs to have certain properties; purely random data will be detected as tampering. To generate appropriate random data, you'll need to use a modified dragon curve.\n\nStart with an appropriate initial state (your puzzle input). Then, so long as you don't have enough data yet to fill the disk, repeat the following steps:\n\nCall the data you have at this point \"a\".\nMake a copy of \"a\"; call this copy \"b\".\nReverse the order of the characters in \"b\".\nIn \"b\", replace all instances of 0 with 1 and all 1s with 0.\nThe resulting data is \"a\", then a single 0, then \"b\".\nFor example, after a single step of this process,\n\n1 becomes 100.\n0 becomes 001.\n11111 becomes 11111000000.\n111100001010 becomes 1111000010100101011110000.\nRepeat these steps until you have enough data to fill the desired disk.\n\nOnce the data has been generated, you also need to create a checksum of that data. Calculate the checksum only for the data that fits on the disk, even if you generated more data than that in the previous step.\n\nThe checksum for some given data is created by considering each non-overlapping pair of characters in the input data. If the two characters match (00 or 11), the next checksum character is a 1. If the characters do not match (01 or 10), the next checksum character is a 0. This should produce a new string which is exactly half as long as the original. If the length of the checksum is even, repeat the process until you end up with a checksum with an odd length.\n\nFor example, suppose we want to fill a disk of length 12, and when we finally generate a string of at least length 12, the first 12 characters are 110010110100. To generate its checksum:\n\nConsider each pair: 11, 00, 10, 11, 01, 00.\nThese are same, same, different, same, different, same, producing 110101.\nThe resulting string has length 6, which is even, so we repeat the process.\nThe pairs are 11 (same), 01 (different), 01 (different).\nThis produces the checksum 100, which has an odd length, so we stop.\nTherefore, the checksum for 110010110100 is 100.\n\nCombining all of these steps together, suppose you want to fill a disk of length 20 using an initial state of 10000:\n\nBecause 10000 is too short, we first use the modified dragon curve to make it longer.\nAfter one round, it becomes 10000011110 (11 characters), still too short.\nAfter two rounds, it becomes 10000011110010000111110 (23 characters), which is enough.\nSince we only need 20, but we have 23, we get rid of all but the first 20 characters: 10000011110010000111.\nNext, we start calculating the checksum; after one round, we have 0111110101, which 10 characters long (even), so we continue.\nAfter two rounds, we have 01100, which is 5 characters long (odd), so we are done.\nIn this example, the correct checksum would therefore be 01100.\n\nThe first disk you have to fill has length 272.

You start in the top-left room (marked S), and you can access the vault (marked V) once you reach the bottom-right room:\n\n#########\n#S| | | #\n#-#-#-#-#\n# | | | #\n#-#-#-#-#\n# | | | #\n#-#-#-#-#\n# | | |  \n####### V\nFixed walls are marked with #, and doors are marked with - or |.\n\nThe doors in your current room are either open or closed (and locked) based on the hexadecimal MD5 hash of a passcode (your puzzle input) followed by a sequence of uppercase characters representing the path you have taken so far (U for up, D for down, L for left, and R for right).\n\nOnly the first four characters of the hash are used; they represent, respectively, the doors up, down, left, and right from your current position. Any b, c, d, e, or f means that the corresponding door is open; any other character (any number or a) means that the corresponding door is closed and locked.\n\nTo access the vault, all you need to do is reach the bottom-right room; reaching this room opens the vault and all doors in the maze.\n\nFor example, suppose the passcode is hijkl. Initially, you have taken no steps, and so your path is empty: you simply find the MD5 hash of hijkl alone. The first four characters of this hash are ced9, which indicate that up is open (c), down is open (e), left is open (d), and right is closed and locked (9). Because you start in the top-left corner, there are no \"up\" or \"left\" doors to be open, so your only choice is down.\n\nNext, having gone only one step (down, or D), you find the hash of hijklD. This produces f2bc, which indicates that you can go back up, left (but that's a wall), or right. Going right means hashing hijklDR to get 5745 - all doors closed and locked. However, going up instead is worthwhile: even though it returns you to the room you started in, your path would then be DU, opening a different set of doors.\n\nAfter going DU (and then hashing hijklDU to get 528e), only the right door is open; after going DUR, all doors lock. (Fortunately, your actual passcode is not hijkl).\n\nPasscodes actually used by Easter Bunny Vault Security do allow access to the vault if you know the right path.

You start in the top-left room (marked S), and you can access the vault (marked V) once you reach the bottom-right room:\n\n#########\n#S| | | #\n#-#-#-#-#\n# | | | #\n#-#-#-#-#\n# | | | #\n#-#-#-#-#\n# | | |  \n####### V\nFixed walls are marked with #, and doors are marked with - or |.\n\nThe doors in your current room are either open or closed (and locked) based on the hexadecimal MD5 hash of a passcode (your puzzle input) followed by a sequence of uppercase characters representing the path you have taken so far (U for up, D for down, L for left, and R for right).\n\nOnly the first four characters of the hash are used; they represent, respectively, the doors up, down, left, and right from your current position. Any b, c, d, e, or f means that the corresponding door is open; any other character (any number or a) means that the corresponding door is closed and locked.\n\nTo access the vault, all you need to do is reach the bottom-right room; reaching this room opens the vault and all doors in the maze.\n\nFor example, suppose the passcode is hijkl. Initially, you have taken no steps, and so your path is empty: you simply find the MD5 hash of hijkl alone. The first four characters of this hash are ced9, which indicate that up is open (c), down is open (e), left is open (d), and right is closed and locked (9). Because you start in the top-left corner, there are no \"up\" or \"left\" doors to be open, so your only choice is down.\n\nNext, having gone only one step (down, or D), you find the hash of hijklD. This produces f2bc, which indicates that you can go back up, left (but that's a wall), or right. Going right means hashing hijklDR to get 5745 - all doors closed and locked. However, going up instead is worthwhile: even though it returns you to the room you started in, your path would then be DU, opening a different set of doors.\n\nAfter going DU (and then hashing hijklDU to get 528e), only the right door is open; after going DUR, all doors lock. (Fortunately, your actual passcode is not hijkl).\n\nPasscodes actually used by Easter Bunny Vault Security do allow access to the vault if you know the right path. For example:\n\nIf your passcode were ihgpwlah, the shortest path would be DDRRRD.\nWith kglvqrro, the shortest path would be DDUDRLRRUDRD.\nWith ulqzkmiv, the shortest would be DRURDRUDDLLDLUURRDULRLDUUDDDRR.\nGiven your vault's passcode, what is the shortest path (the actual path, not just the length) to reach the vault?\n\nYour puzzle answer was DUDRLRRDDR.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nYou're curious how robust this security solution really is, and so you decide to find longer and longer paths which still provide access to the vault. You remember that paths always end the first time they reach the bottom-right room (that is, they can never pass through it, only end in it).\n\nFor example:\n\nIf your passcode were ihgpwlah, the longest path would take 370 steps.\nWith kglvqrro, the longest path would be 492 steps long.\nWith ulqzkmiv, the longest path would be 830 steps long.\nWhat is the length of the longest path that reaches the vault?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule Task do\n  def calculate(input) do\n    calculate([{input, 0, 0}], 0)\n  end\n  def calculate([], index) do\n    IO.puts \"Dead end on index #{index}\"\n  end\n  def calculate(list, index) do\n    list = Enum.reduce(list, [], &(add_possible(&1, &2, index)))\n    calculate(list, index + 1)\n  end\n\n  def add_possible(old, acc, index) do\n    possible(old, index) ++ acc\n  end\n\n  def possible({input, 3, 3}, index) do\n    IO.puts(\"Found a solution on index #{index}\")\n    []\n  end\n  def possible({input, _x, _y} = old, _index) do\n    hash = :crypto.hash(:md5, input) |> Base.encode16(case: :lower) |> String.graphemes\n    all_moves\n      |> Enum.filter(&(check_move(hash, &1)))\n      |> Enum.map(&(complete_move(old, &1)))\n      |> Enum.filter(&allowed_move?/1)\n  end\n\n  def complete_move({input, x, y}, {c, _i, dx, dy}) do\n    {input <> c, x + dx, y + dy}\n  end\n\n  def all_moves do\n    [{\"U\", 0, 0, -1}, {\"D\", 1, 0, 1}, {\"L\", 2, -1, 0}, {\"R\", 3, 1, 0}]\n  end\n\n  def check_move(hash, {_c, i, _dx, _dy}) do\n    Enum.at(hash, i) |> open?\n  end\n\n  def allowed_move?({_i, x, _y}) when x < 0, do: false\n  def allowed_move?({_i, x, _y}) when x > 3, do: false\n  def allowed_move?({_i, _x, y}) when y < 0, do: false\n  def allowed_move?({_i, _x, y}) when y > 3, do: false\n  def allowed_move?(_), do: true\n\n  def open?(\"b\"), do: true\n  def open?(\"c\"), do: true\n  def open?(\"d\"), do: true\n  def open?(\"e\"), do: true\n  def open?(\"f\"), do: true\n  def open?(_), do: false\nend\n\ninput = File.read!(\"input.txt\")\nresult = Task.calculate(input)\nIO.inspect result\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

The tiles are arranged into rows that are all the same width; you take note of the safe tiles (.) and traps (^) in the first row (your puzzle input).\n\nThe type of tile (trapped or safe) in each row is based on the types of the tiles in the same position, and to either side of that position, in the previous row. (If either side is off either end of the row, it counts as \"safe\" because there isn't a trap embedded in the wall.)\n\nFor example, suppose you know the first row (with tiles marked by letters) and want to determine the next row (with tiles marked by numbers):\n\nABCDE\n12345\nThe type of tile 2 is based on the types of tiles A, B, and C; the type of tile 5 is based on tiles D, E, and an imaginary \"safe\" tile.

Starting with the password to be scrambled, apply each operation in succession to the string. The individual operations behave as follows:\n\nswap position X with position Y means that the letters at indexes X and Y (counting from 0) should be swapped.\nswap letter X with letter Y means that the letters X and Y should be swapped (regardless of where they appear in the string).\nrotate left/right X steps means that the whole string should be rotated; for example, one right rotation would turn abcd into dabc.\nrotate based on position of letter X means that the whole string should be rotated to the right based on the index of letter X (counting from 0) as determined before this instruction does any rotations. Once the index is determined, rotate the string to the right one time, plus a number of times equal to that index, plus one additional time if the index was at least 4.\nreverse positions X through Y means that the span of letters at indexes X through Y (including the letters at X and Y) should be reversed in order.\nmove position X to position Y means that the letter which is at index X should be removed from the string, then inserted such that it ends up at index Y.\nFor example, suppose you start with abcde and perform the following operations:\n\nswap position 4 with position 0 swaps the first and last letters, producing the input for the next step, ebcda.\nswap letter d with letter b swaps the positions of d and b: edcba.\nreverse positions 0 through 4 causes the entire string to be reversed, producing abcde.\nrotate left 1 step shifts all letters left one position, causing the first letter to wrap to the end of the string: bcdea.\nmove position 1 to position 4 removes the letter at position 1 (c), then inserts it at position 4 (the end of the string): bdeac.\nmove position 3 to position 0 removes the letter at position 3 (a), then inserts it at position 0 (the front of the string): abdec.\nrotate based on position of letter b finds the index of letter b (1), then rotates the string right once plus a number of times equal to that index (2): ecabd.\nrotate based on position of letter d finds the index of letter d (4), then rotates the string right once, plus a number of times equal to that index, plus an additional time because the index was at least 4, for a total of 6 right rotations: decab.\nAfter these steps, the resulting scrambled password is decab.\n\nNow, you just need to generate a new scrambled password and you can access the system.

The node you can access directly, node-x0-y0, is almost full. The node containing the data you want to access, node-x2-y0 (because it has y=0 and the highest x value), contains 6 terabytes of data - enough to fit on your node, if only you could make enough space to move it there.\n\nFortunately, node-x1-y1 looks like it has enough free space to enable you to move some of this data around. In fact, it seems like all of the nodes have enough space to hold any node's data (except node-x0-y2, which is much larger, very full, and not moving any time soon). So, initially, the grid's capacities and connections look like this:\n\n( 8T/10T) --  7T/ 9T -- [ 6T/10T]\n    |           |           |\n  6T/11T  --  0T/ 8T --   8T/ 9T\n    |           |           |\n 28T/32T  --  7T/11T --   6T/ 9T\nThe node you can access directly is in parentheses; the data you want starts in the node marked by square brackets.\n\nIn this example, most of the nodes are interchangable: they're full enough that no other node's data would fit, but small enough that their data could be moved around. Let's draw these nodes as .. The exceptions are the empty node, which we'll draw as _, and the very large, very full node, which we'll draw as #. Let's also draw the goal data as G. Then, it looks like this:\n\n(.) .  G\n .  _  .\n #  .  .\nThe goal is to move the data in the top right, G, to the node in parentheses. To do this, we can issue some commands to the grid and rearrange the data:\n\nMove data from node-y0-x1 to node-y1-x1, leaving node node-y0-x1 empty:\n\n(.) _  G\n .  .  .\n #  .  .\nMove the goal data from node-y0-x2 to node-y0-x1:\n\n(.) G  _\n .  .  .\n #  .  .\nAt this point, we're quite close. However, we have no deletion command, so we have to move some more data around. So, next, we move the data from node-y1-x2 to node-y0-x2:\n\n(.) G  .\n .  .  _\n #  .  .\nMove the data from node-y1-x1 to node-y1-x2:\n\n(.) G  .\n .  _  .\n #  .  .\nMove the data from node-y1-x0 to node-y1-x1:\n\n(.) G  .\n _  .  .\n #  .  .\nNext, we can free up space on our node by moving the data from node-y0-x0 to node-y1-x0:\n\n(_) G  .\n .  .  .\n #  .  .\nFinally, we can access the goal data by moving the it from node-y0-x1 to node-y0-x0:\n\n(G) _  .\n .  .  .\n #  .  .\nSo, after 7 steps, we've accessed the data we want. Unfortunately, each of these moves takes time, and we need to be efficient:\n\nWhat is the fewest number of steps required to move your goal data to node-x0-y0?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\n# ExUnit.start\n\ndefmodule Node do\n  defstruct x: nil, y: nil, size: nil, used: nil, important: false\n  defimpl String.Chars, for: Node do\n    def to_string(node), do: \"#{node.x}:#{node.y}, size: #{node.size} used: #{node.used}\"\n  end\nend\n\ndefmodule Task2 do\n  # use ExUnit.Case\n\n  def parse_line(string) do\n    [node, size, used, _free, _usage] = Regex.split(~r/\\s+/, string)\n    [_, x, y] = Regex.run(~r/x(\\d+)-y(\\d+)/, node)\n    x = String.to_integer(x)\n    y = String.to_integer(y)\n    {size, \"T\"} = Integer.parse(size)\n    {used, \"T\"} = Integer.parse(used)\n    # {free, \"T\"} = Integer.parse(free)\n    %Node{x: x, y: y, size: size, used: used}\n  end\n\n  def mark_important(nodes) do\n    old = node_at(nodes, nodes |> starting)\n    replace(nodes, old, %{old | important: true})\n  end\n\n  def run_first(nodes), do: run_first([{nodes, free(nodes), []}], free_destination(nodes), [free(nodes)], nil)\n  def run_first([], _target, _covered, _found) do\n    IO.puts(\"Got stuck!\")\n  end\n  def run_first(current, target, covered, nil) do\n    {current, covered} = Enum.reduce(current, {[], covered}, &next_steps/2)\n    found = Enum.find(current, &(check?(&1, target)))\n    run_first(current, target, covered, found)\n  end\n  def run_first(_current, _target, _covered, {nodes, coords, path}) do\n    {nodes, coords, path}\n  end\n\n  def run_bridge(current) do\n    force_move({1, 0}, current)\n  end\n\n  def run_second(current), do: run_second(current, false)\n  def run_second(current, true), do: current\n  def run_second(current, false) do\n    current = Enum.reduce(rotate_moves, current, &force_move/2)\n    {nodes, _coords, _log} = current\n    found = node_at(nodes, {0, 0}).important\n    run_second(current, found)\n  end\n\n  def force_move({dx, dy}, {nodes, {x, y} = old_coords, log}) do\n    old = node_at(nodes, old_coords)\n    new_coords = {x + dx, y + dy}\n    new = node_at(nodes, new_coords)\n    moved = move(nodes, old, new)\n    {moved, new_coords, [new_coords | log]}\n  end\n\n  def rotate_moves, do: [{0, 1}, {-1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}]\n\n  def check?({_nodes, {x, y}, _log}, {x, y}), do: true\n  def check?(_, _), do: false\n\n  def next_steps(from, acc) do\n    Enum.reduce(directions, acc, &(add_step(from, &1, &2)))\n  end\n\n  def add_step({nodes, {x, y} = old_coords, log}, {dx, dy}, {result, covered}) do\n    old = node_at(nodes, old_coords)\n    new_coords = {x + dx, y + dy}\n    new = node_at(nodes, new_coords)\n    not_covered = !Enum.member?(covered, new_coords)\n    check = can_move?(old, new)\n    if (check && not_covered) do\n      moved = move(nodes, old, new)\n      {[{moved, new_coords, [new_coords | log]} | result], [new_coords | covered]}\n    else\n      {result, covered}\n    end\n  end\n\n  def can_move?(_old, nil), do: false\n  def can_move?(old, new), do: (old.size - old.used) >= new.used\n\n  def move(nodes, old, new) do\n    if (old == nil || new == nil || (old.size < old.used + new.used)), do: throw(\"Cannot Move!\")\n    nodes = replace(nodes, old, %{old | used: old.used + new.used, important: new.important})\n    nodes = replace(nodes, new, %{new | used: 0, important: false})\n    nodes\n  end\n\n  def directions, do: [{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}]\n\n  def node_at(nodes, {x, y}) do\n    Enum.find(nodes, &(&1.x == x && &1.y == y))\n  end\n\n  def index_of(nodes, search) do\n    Enum.find_index(nodes, &(&1 == search))\n  end\n\n  def replace(nodes, old, new) do\n    index = index_of(nodes, old)\n    List.replace_at(nodes, index, new)\n  end\n\n  def starting(nodes) do\n    max_x = Enum.reduce(nodes, 0, &(if (&1.x > &2), do: &1.x, else: &2))\n    {max_x, 0}\n  end\n  def ending(_nodes), do: {0, 0}\n  def free(nodes) do\n    top = nodes |> Enum.sort_by(&(&1.size - &1.used), &>=/2) |> hd\n    {top.x, top.y}\n  end\n  def free_destination(nodes) do\n    {x, y} = starting(nodes)\n    {x - 1, y}\n  end\n\n  def calculate do\n    parsed_input\n      |> mark_important\n      |> run_first\n      |> run_bridge\n      |> run_second\n      |> count_log\n  end\n\n  def count_log({_nodes, _current, log}), do: length(log)\n\n  def input do\n    {:ok, result} = File.read(\"input.txt\")\n    result\n  end\n\n  def parsed_input do\n    input\n      |> String.split(\"\\n\")\n      |> Enum.drop(2)\n      |> List.delete_at(-1)\n      |> Enum.map(&parse_line/1)\n  end\nend\n\nresult = Task2.calculate\nIO.puts(\"Result is #{result}\")\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

You simply can't reach them.\n\nThe robot that cleans the air ducts, however, can.\n\nIt's not a very fast little robot, but you reconfigure it to be able to interface with some of the exposed wires that have been routed through the HVAC system. If you can direct it to each of those locations, you should be able to bypass the security controls.\n\nYou extract the duct layout for this area from some blueprints you acquired and create a map with the relevant locations marked (your puzzle input). 0 is your current location, from which the cleaning robot embarks; the other numbers are (in no particular order) the locations the robot needs to visit at least once each.

After all, the sleigh doesn't need the stars, exactly; it needs the timing data they provide, and you happen to have a massive signal generator right here.\n\nYou connect the stars you have to your prototype computer, connect that to the antenna, and begin the transmission.\n\nNothing happens.\n\nYou call the service number printed on the side of the antenna and quickly explain the situation. \"I'm not sure what kind of equipment you have connected over there,\" he says, \"but you need a clock signal.\" You try to explain that this is a signal for a clock.\n\n\"No, no, a clock signal - timing information so the antenna computer knows how to read the data you're sending it.

A recursive algorithm has gotten out of hand, and now they're balanced precariously in a large tower.\n\nOne program at the bottom supports the entire tower. It's holding a large disc, and on the disc are balanced several more sub-towers. At the bottom of these sub-towers, standing on the bottom disc, are other programs, each holding their own disc, and so on. At the very tops of these sub-sub-sub-...-towers, many programs stand simply keeping the disc below them balanced but with no disc of their own.\n\nYou offer to help, but first you need to understand the structure of these towers. You ask each program to yell out their name, their weight, and (if they're holding a disc) the names of the programs immediately above them balancing on that disc. You write this information down (your puzzle input). Unfortunately, in their panic, they don't do this in an orderly fashion; by the time you're done, you're not sure which program gave which information.\n\nFor example, if your list is the following:\n\npbga (66)\nxhth (57)\nebii (61)\nhavc (66)\nktlj (57)\nfwft (72) -> ktlj, cntj, xhth\nqoyq (66)\npadx (45) -> pbga, havc, qoyq\ntknk (41) -> ugml, padx, fwft\njptl (61)\nugml (68) -> gyxo, ebii, jptl\ngyxo (61)\ncntj (57)\n...then you would be able to recreate the structure of the towers that looks like this:\n\n              gyxo\n            /     \n        ugml - ebii\n      /           \n    |         jptl\n    |        \n    |         pbga\n    /        /\ntknk --- padx - havc\n                |         qoyq\n    |             \n    |         ktlj\n            /     \n        fwft - cntj\n                 \n              xhth\nIn this example, tknk is at the bottom of the tower (the bottom program), and is holding up ugml, padx, and fwft. Those programs are, in turn, holding up other programs; in this example, none of those programs are holding up any other programs, and are all the tops of their own towers. (The actual tower balancing in front of you is much larger.)\n\nBefore you're ready to help them, you need to make sure your information is correct.

The hash these programs are implementing isn't very strong, but you decide to help them anyway. You make a mental note to remind the Elves later not to invent their own cryptographic functions.\n\nThis hash function simulates tying a knot in a circle of string with 256 marks on it. Based on the input to be hashed, the function repeatedly selects a span of string, brings the ends together, and gives the span a half-twist to reverse the order of the marks within it. After doing this many times, the order of the marks is used to build the resulting hash.\n\n4--5   pinch   4  5           4   1\n/      5,0,1  / /   twist  /  / 3      0  -->  3      0  -->  3   X   0\n    /          / /          /  /\n2--1           2  1           2   5\nTo achieve this, begin with a list of numbers from 0 to 255, a current position which begins at 0 (the first element in the list), a skip size (which starts at 0), and a sequence of lengths (your puzzle input). Then, for each length:\n\nReverse the order of that length of elements in the list, starting with the element at the current position.\nMove the current position forward by that length plus the skip size.\nIncrease the skip size by one.\nThe list is circular; if the current position and the length try to reverse elements beyond the end of the list, the operation reverses using as many extra elements as it needs from the front of the list. If the current position moves past the end of the list, it wraps around to the front. Lengths larger than the size of the list are invalid.\n\nHere's an example using a smaller list:\n\nSuppose we instead only had a circular list containing five elements, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and were given input lengths of 3, 4, 1, 5.\n\nThe list begins as [0] 1 2 3 4 (where square brackets indicate the current position).\nThe first length, 3, selects ([0] 1 2) 3 4 (where parentheses indicate the sublist to be reversed).\nAfter reversing that section (0 1 2 into 2 1 0), we get ([2] 1 0) 3 4.\nThen, the current position moves forward by the length, 3, plus the skip size, 0: 2 1 0 [3] 4. Finally, the skip size increases to 1.\nThe second length, 4, selects a section which wraps: 2 1) 0 ([3] 4.\nThe sublist 3 4 2 1 is reversed to form 1 2 4 3: 4 3) 0 ([1] 2.\nThe current position moves forward by the length plus the skip size, a total of 5, causing it not to move because it wraps around: 4 3 0 [1] 2.

The skip size increases to 4.\nIn this example, the first two numbers in the list end up being 3 and 4; to check the process, you can multiply them together to produce 12.\n\nHowever, you should instead use the standard list size of 256 (with values 0 to 255) and the sequence of lengths in your puzzle input.

Once this process is complete, what is the result of multiplying the first two numbers in the list?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 40132.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe logic you've constructed forms a single round of the Knot Hash algorithm; running the full thing requires many of these rounds. Some input and output processing is also required.\n\nFirst, from now on, your input should be taken not as a list of numbers, but as a string of bytes instead. Unless otherwise specified, convert characters to bytes using their ASCII codes. This will allow you to handle arbitrary ASCII strings, and it also ensures that your input lengths are never larger than 255. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, you should convert it to the ASCII codes for each character: 49,44,50,44,51.\n\nOnce you have determined the sequence of lengths to use, add the following lengths to the end of the sequence: 17, 31, 73, 47, 23. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, your final sequence of lengths should be 49,44,50,44,51,17,31,73,47,23 (the ASCII codes from the input string combined with the standard length suffix values).\n\nSecond, instead of merely running one round like you did above, run a total of 64 rounds, using the same length sequence in each round. The current position and skip size should be preserved between rounds. For example, if the previous example was your first round, you would start your second round with the same length sequence (3, 4, 1, 5, 17, 31, 73, 47, 23, now assuming they came from ASCII codes and include the suffix), but start with the previous round's current position (4) and skip size (4).\n\nOnce the rounds are complete, you will be left with the numbers from 0 to 255 in some order, called the sparse hash. Your next task is to reduce these to a list of only 16 numbers called the dense hash. To do this, use numeric bitwise XOR to combine each consecutive block of 16 numbers in the sparse hash (there are 16 such blocks in a list of 256 numbers). So, the first element in the dense hash is the first sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, the second element in the dense hash is the second sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, etc.\n\nFor example, if the first sixteen elements of your sparse hash are as shown below, and the XOR operator is ^, you would calculate the first output number like this:\n\n65 ^ 27 ^ 9 ^ 1 ^ 4 ^ 3 ^ 40 ^ 50 ^ 91 ^ 7 ^ 6 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 5 ^ 68 ^ 22 = 64\nPerform this operation on each of the sixteen blocks of sixteen numbers in your sparse hash to determine the sixteen numbers in your dense hash.\n\nFinally, the standard way to represent a Knot Hash is as a single hexadecimal string; the final output is the dense hash in hexadecimal notation. Because each number in your dense hash will be between 0 and 255 (inclusive), always represent each number as two hexadecimal digits (including a leading zero as necessary). So, if your first three numbers are 64, 7, 255, they correspond to the hexadecimal numbers 40, 07, ff, and so the first six characters of the hash would be 4007ff. Because every Knot Hash is sixteen such numbers, the hexadecimal representation is always 32 hexadecimal digits (0-f) long.\n\nHere are some example hashes:\n\nThe empty string becomes a2582a3a0e66e6e86e3812dcb672a272.\nAoC 2017 becomes 33efeb34ea91902bb2f59c9920caa6cd.\n1,2,3 becomes 3efbe78a8d82f29979031a4aa0b16a9d.\n1,2,4 becomes 63960835bcdc130f0b66d7ff4f6a5a8e.\nTreating your puzzle input as a string of ASCII characters, what is the Knot Hash of your puzzle input?

Messages are passed between programs using these pipes, but most programs aren't connected to each other directly. Instead, programs pass messages between each other until the message reaches the intended recipient.\n\nFor some reason, though, some of these messages aren't ever reaching their intended recipient, and the programs suspect that some pipes are missing. They would like you to investigate.\n\nYou walk through the village and record the ID of each program and the IDs with which it can communicate directly (your puzzle input). Each program has one or more programs with which it can communicate, and these pipes are bidirectional; if 8 says it can communicate with 11, then 11 will say it can communicate with 8.\n\nYou need to figure out how many programs are in the group that contains program ID 0.\n\nFor example, suppose you go door-to-door like a travelling salesman and record the following list:\n\n0 <-> 2\n1 <-> 1\n2 <-> 0, 3, 4\n3 <-> 2, 4\n4 <-> 2, 3, 6\n5 <-> 6\n6 <-> 4, 5\nIn this example, the following programs are in the group that contains program ID 0:\n\nProgram 0 by definition.\nProgram 2, directly connected to program 0.\nProgram 3 via program 2.\nProgram 4 via program 2.\nProgram 5 via programs 6, then 4, then 2.\nProgram 6 via programs 4, then 2.\nTherefore, a total of 6 programs are in this group; all but program 1, which has a pipe that connects it to itself.\n\nHow many programs are in the group that contains program ID 0?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule DigitalPlumber do\n  def call do\n    input = File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n    |> String.split(\"\\n\")\n    |> Enum.map(&String.split(&1, \" <-> \"))\n    |> Enum.map(fn [prog, conns] -> {String.to_integer(prog), String.split(conns, \", \") |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)} end)\n\n    graph = Map.new(input)\n\n    group = bfs(graph, 0, [])\n\n    length(group)\n  end\n\n  def bfs(graph, start, visited) do\n    case Map.get(graph, start) do\n      nil -> visited\n      conns ->\n        new_visited = visited ++ [start]\n        new_nodes = conns -- new_visited\n        Enum.reduce(new_nodes, new_visited, fn node, acc -> bfs(graph, node, acc) end)\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

The firewall consists of several layers, each with a security scanner that moves back and forth across the layer. To succeed, you must not be detected by a scanner.\n\nBy studying the firewall briefly, you are able to record (in your puzzle input) the depth of each layer and the range of the scanning area for the scanner within it, written as depth: range. Each layer has a thickness of exactly 1. A layer at depth 0 begins immediately inside the firewall; a layer at depth 1 would start immediately after that.\n\nFor example, suppose you've recorded the following:\n\n0: 3\n1: 2\n4: 4\n6: 4\nThis means that there is a layer immediately inside the firewall (with range 3), a second layer immediately after that (with range 2), a third layer which begins at depth 4 (with range 4), and a fourth layer which begins at depth 6 (also with range 4). Visually, it might look like this:\n\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[ ] [ ] ... ... [ ] ...

You are not caught in layer 1, since the scanner moved into the top of the layer once you were already there.\n\nThe severity of getting caught on a layer is equal to its depth multiplied by its range. (Ignore layers in which you do not get caught.) The severity of the whole trip is the sum of these values. In the example above, the trip severity is 0*3 + 6*4 = 24.\n\nGiven the details of the firewall you've recorded, if you leave immediately, what is the severity of your whole trip?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 1960.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow, you need to pass through the firewall without being caught - easier said than done.\n\nYou can't control the speed of the packet, but you can delay it any number of picoseconds. For each picosecond you delay the packet before beginning your trip, all security scanners move one step. You're not in the firewall during this time; you don't enter layer 0 until you stop delaying the packet.\n\nIn the example above, if you delay 10 picoseconds (picoseconds 0 - 9), you won't get caught:\n\nState after delaying:\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[ ] [S] ... ...

Here, in the expansive central chamber, you find a grand apparatus that fills the entire room, suspended nanometers above your head.\n\nYou had always imagined CPUs to be noisy, chaotic places, bustling with activity. Instead, the room is quiet, motionless, and dark.\n\nSuddenly, you and the CPU's garbage collector startle each other. \"It's not often we get many visitors here!\", he says. You inquire about the stopped machinery.\n\n\"It stopped milliseconds ago; not sure why. I'm a garbage collector, not a doctor.\" You ask what the machine is for.\n\n\"Programs these days, don't know their origins. That's the Turing machine! It's what makes the whole computer work.\" You try to explain that Turing machines are merely models of computation, but he cuts you off. \"No, see, that's just what they want you to think. Ultimately, inside every CPU, there's a Turing machine driving the whole thing! Too bad this one's broken. We're doomed!\"\n\nYou ask how you can help. \"Well, unfortunately, the only way to get the computer running again would be to create a whole new Turing machine from scratch, but there's no way you can-\" He notices the look on your face, gives you a curious glance, shrugs, and goes back to sweeping the floor.\n\nYou find the Turing machine blueprints (your puzzle input) on a tablet in a nearby pile of debris. Looking back up at the broken Turing machine above, you can start to identify its parts:\n\nA tape which contains 0 repeated infinitely to the left and right.\nA cursor, which can move left or right along the tape and read or write values at its current position.\nA set of states, each containing rules about what to do based on the current value under the cursor.\nEach slot on the tape has two possible values: 0 (the starting value for all slots) and 1. Based on whether the cursor is pointing at a 0 or a 1, the current state says what value to write at the current position of the cursor, whether to move the cursor left or right one slot, and which state to use next.\n\nFor example, suppose you found the following blueprint:\n\nBegin in state A.\nPerform a diagnostic checksum after 6 steps.\n\nIn state A:\nIf the current value is 0:\n  - Write the value 1.\n  - Move one slot to the right.\n  - Continue with state B.\nIf the current value is 1:\n  - Write the value 0.\n  - Move one slot to the left.\n  - Continue with state B.\n\nIn state B:\nIf the current value is 0:\n  - Write the value 1.\n  - Move one slot to the left.\n  - Continue with state A.\nIf the current value is 1:\n  - Write the value 1.\n  - Move one slot to the right.\n  - Continue with state A.\nRunning it until the number of steps required to take the listed diagnostic checksum would result in the following tape configurations (with the cursor marked in square brackets):\n\n... 0  0  0 [0] 0  0 ... (before any steps; about to run state A)\n... 0  0  0  1 [0] 0 ... (after 1 step;     about to run state B)\n... 0  0  0 [1] 1  0 ... (after 2 steps;    about to run state A)\n... 0  0 [0] 0  1  0 ... (after 3 steps;    about to run state B)\n... 0 [0] 1  0  1  0 ... (after 4 steps;    about to run state A)\n... 0  1 [1] 0  1  0 ... (after 5 steps;    about to run state B)\n... 0  1  1 [0] 1  0 ... (after 6 steps;    about to run state A)\nThe CPU can confirm that the Turing machine is working by taking a diagnostic checksum after a specific number of steps (given in the blueprint). Once the specified number of steps have been executed, the Turing machine should pause; once it does, count the number of times 1 appears on the tape. In the above example, the diagnostic checksum is 3.\n\nRecreate the Turing machine and save the computer! What is the diagnostic checksum it produces once it's working again?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule Day25 do\n  def call do\n    {initial_state, steps, states} = read_input(\"input.txt\")\n    checksum = run_turing_machine(initial_state, steps, states)\n    IO.puts(checksum)\n  end\n\n  defp read_input(file_path) do\n    content = File.read!(file_path)\n    steps = 12_586_542\n    initial_state = :A\n    states = parse_states(content)\n    {initial_state, steps, states}\n  end\n\n  defp parse_states(content) do\n    content\n    |> String.split(\"In state \", trim: true)\n    |> Enum.drop(1) # Drop the initial part before the first state definition\n    |> Enum.map(&parse_state/1)\n    |> Enum.into(%{})\n  end\n\n  defp parse_state(state_info) do\n    [state_letter | actions] = String.split(state_info, \":\", parts: 2)\n    actions_string = Enum.at(actions, 0)\n    \n    actions_parsed = actions_string\n    |> String.split(\"If the current value is \", trim: true)\n    |> Enum.drop(1) # Drop the initial part before the first action definition\n    |> Enum.map(&parse_action/1)\n\n    {String.to_atom(state_letter), actions_parsed}\n  end\n\ndefp parse_action(action_info) do\n  [value | rest] = String.split(action_info, \":\", parts: 2)\n  rest_string = Enum.at(rest, 0)\n\n  matches = \n    Regex.scan(~r/- Write the value (\\d+).*?- Move one slot to the (right|left).*?- Continue with state (\\w)./ms, rest_string, capture: :all_but_first)\n    |> List.first()\n\n  case matches do\n    [write_value, move_direction, continue_state] ->\n      move = case move_direction do\n        \"right\" -> 1\n        \"left\" -> -1\n      end\n\n      {String.to_integer(value), String.to_integer(write_value), move, String.to_atom(continue_state)}\n  end\nend\n\n  # The rest of the implementation remains unchanged\n  defp run_turing_machine(initial_state, steps, states) do\n    final_tape = Enum.reduce(0..steps-1, {%{0 => 0}, 0, initial_state}, fn _, {tape, cursor, state} ->\n      actions = Map.get(states, state)\n      current_value = Map.get(tape, cursor, 0)\n      {_, write_value, move, next_state} = Enum.at(actions, current_value)\n      \n      new_tape = Map.put(tape, cursor, write_value)\n      new_cursor = cursor + move\n      {new_tape, new_cursor, next_state}\n    end)\n    |> elem(0)\n    |> Map.values()\n    |> Enum.filter(&(&1 == 1))\n    |> length()\n\n    final_tape\n  end\nend\n\nDay25.call()\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

In this example, the steps would be completed as follows:\n\nOnly C is available, and so it is done first.\nNext, both A and F are available. A is first alphabetically, so it is done next.\nThen, even though F was available earlier, steps B and D are now also available, and B is the first alphabetically of the three.\nAfter that, only D and F are available. E is not available because only some of its prerequisites are complete. Therefore, D is completed next.\nF is the only choice, so it is done next.\nFinally, E is completed.\nSo, in this example, the correct order is CABDFE.\n\nIn what order should the steps in your instructions be completed?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule Day7 do\n  def call do\n    instructions = read_input(\"input.txt\")\n    order = determine_order(instructions)\n    IO.puts(\"Order of completion: #{order}\")\n  end\n\n  defp read_input(file_path) do\n    File.read!(file_path)\n    |> String.split(\"\\n\", trim: true)\n  end\n\n  defp determine_order(instructions) do\n    deps = Enum.reduce(instructions, %{}, fn instruction, acc ->\n      [_, step_before, step_after] = Regex.run(~r/Step (\\w) must be finished before step (\\w) can begin./, instruction)\n      acc\n      |> Map.update(step_after, [step_before], &[step_before | &1])\n      |> Map.update(step_before, [], &(&1))\n    end)\n\n    steps = Map.keys(deps) |> Enum.sort()\n    complete_order(steps, deps, \"\")\n  end\n\n  defp complete_order([], _deps, order), do: order\n\n  defp complete_order(steps, deps, order) do\n    next_step = Enum.find(steps, fn step ->\n      deps[step] |> Enum.all?(fn dep -> not Enum.member?(steps, dep) end)\n    end)\n\n    updated_steps = steps -- [next_step]\n    updated_order = order <> next_step\n\n    complete_order(updated_steps, deps, updated_order)\n  end\nend\n\nDay7.call()\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

To pass the time, they introduce you to their favorite marble game.\n\nThe Elves play this game by taking turns arranging the marbles in a circle according to very particular rules. The marbles are numbered starting with 0 and increasing by 1 until every marble has a number.\n\nFirst, the marble numbered 0 is placed in the circle. At this point, while it contains only a single marble, it is still a circle: the marble is both clockwise from itself and counter-clockwise from itself. This marble is designated the current marble.\n\nThen, each Elf takes a turn placing the lowest-numbered remaining marble into the circle between the marbles that are 1 and 2 marbles clockwise of the current marble. (When the circle is large enough, this means that there is one marble between the marble that was just placed and the current marble.) The marble that was just placed then becomes the current marble.\n\nHowever, if the marble that is about to be placed has a number which is a multiple of 23, something entirely different happens. First, the current player keeps the marble they would have placed, adding it to their score. In addition, the marble 7 marbles counter-clockwise from the current marble is removed from the circle and also added to the current player's score. The marble located immediately clockwise of the marble that was removed becomes the new current marble.\n\nFor example, suppose there are 9 players. After the marble with value 0 is placed in the middle, each player (shown in square brackets) takes a turn. The result of each of those turns would produce circles of marbles like this, where clockwise is to the right and the resulting current marble is in parentheses:\n\n[-] (0)\n[1]  0 (1)\n[2]  0 (2) 1 \n[3]  0  2  1 (3)\n[4]  0 (4) 2  1  3 \n[5]  0  4  2 (5) 1  3 \n[6]  0  4  2  5  1 (6) 3 \n[7]  0  4  2  5  1  6  3 (7)\n[8]  0 (8) 4  2  5  1  6  3  7 \n[9]  0  8  4 (9) 2  5  1  6  3  7 \n[1]  0  8  4  9  2(10) 5  1  6  3  7 \n[2]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5(11) 1  6  3  7 \n[3]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1(12) 6  3  7 \n[4]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6(13) 3  7 \n[5]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3(14) 7 \n[6]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7(15)\n[7]  0(16) 8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[8]  0 16  8(17) 4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[9]  0 16  8 17  4(18) 9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[1]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9(19) 2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[2]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9 19  2(20)10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[3]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9 19  2 20 10(21) 5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[4]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9 19  2 20 10 21  5(22)11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[5]  0 16  8 17  4 18(19) 2 20 10 21  5 22 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[6]  0 16  8 17  4 18 19  2(24)20 10 21  5 22 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[7]  0 16  8 17  4 18 19  2 24 20(25)10 21  5 22 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15\nThe goal is to be the player with the highest score after the last marble is used up.

Apparently, you forgot to include additional fuel for the fuel you just added.\n\nFuel itself requires fuel just like a module - take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2. However, that fuel also requires fuel, and that fuel requires fuel, and so on. Any mass that would require negative fuel should instead be treated as if it requires zero fuel; the remaining mass, if any, is instead handled by wishing really hard, which has no mass and is outside the scope of this calculation.\n\nSo, for each module mass, calculate its fuel and add it to the total. Then, treat the fuel amount you just calculated as the input mass and repeat the process, continuing until a fuel requirement is zero or negative. For example:\n\nA module of mass 14 requires 2 fuel. This fuel requires no further fuel (2 divided by 3 and rounded down is 0, which would call for a negative fuel), so the total fuel required is still just 2.\nAt first, a module of mass 1969 requires 654 fuel. Then, this fuel requires 216 more fuel (654 / 3 - 2). 216 then requires 70 more fuel, which requires 21 fuel, which requires 5 fuel, which requires no further fuel. So, the total fuel required for a module of mass 1969 is 654 + 216 + 70 + 21 + 5 = 966.\nThe fuel required by a module of mass 100756 and its fuel is: 33583 + 11192 + 3728 + 1240 + 411 + 135 + 43 + 12 + 2 = 50346.\nWhat is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft when also taking into account the mass of the added fuel?

On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: \"Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--\" The ship computer bursts into flames.\n\nYou notify the Elves that the computer's magic smoke seems to have escaped. \"That computer ran Intcode programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!\"\n\nAn Intcode program is a list of integers separated by commas (like 1,0,0,3,99). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position 0). Here, you will find an opcode - either 1, 2, or 99. The opcode indicates what to do; for example, 99 means that the program is finished and should immediately halt. Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.\n\nOpcode 1 adds together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.\n\nFor example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.\n\nOpcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.\n\nOnce you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following program:\n\n1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50\nFor the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:\n\n1,9,10,3,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nThe first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the output (3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:\n\n1,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStep forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively. Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:\n\n3500,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode 99, halting the program.\n\nHere are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:\n\n1,0,0,0,99 becomes 2,0,0,0,99 (1 + 1 = 2).\n2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,6,99 (3 * 2 = 6).\n2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,9801 (99 * 99 = 9801).\n1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99 becomes 30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99.\nOnce you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity assist program (your puzzle input) to the \"1202 program alarm\" state it had just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the value 2.

Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.\n\nOnce you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following program:\n\n1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50\nFor the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:\n\n1,9,10,3,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nThe first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the output (3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:\n\n1,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStep forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively. Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:\n\n3500,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode 99, halting the program.\n\nHere are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:\n\n1,0,0,0,99 becomes 2,0,0,0,99 (1 + 1 = 2).\n2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,6,99 (3 * 2 = 6).\n2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,9801 (99 * 99 = 9801).\n1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99 becomes 30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99.\nOnce you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity assist program (your puzzle input) to the \"1202 program alarm\" state it had just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the value 2. What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 4714701.\n\n--- Part Two ---\n\"Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly! Keep it nearby during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what they are as you need them.\"\n\n\"However, your current priority should be to complete your gravity assist around the Moon. For this mission to succeed, we should settle on some terminology for the parts you've already built.\"\n\nIntcode programs are given as a list of integers; these values are used as the initial state for the computer's memory. When you run an Intcode program, make sure to start by initializing memory to the program's values. A position in memory is called an address (for example, the first value in memory is at \"address 0\").\n\nOpcodes (like 1, 2, or 99) mark the beginning of an instruction. The values used immediately after an opcode, if any, are called the instruction's parameters. For example, in the instruction 1,2,3,4, 1 is the opcode; 2, 3, and 4 are the parameters. The instruction 99 contains only an opcode and has no parameters.\n\nThe address of the current instruction is called the instruction pointer; it starts at 0. After an instruction finishes, the instruction pointer increases by the number of values in the instruction; until you add more instructions to the computer, this is always 4 (1 opcode + 3 parameters) for the add and multiply instructions. (The halt instruction would increase the instruction pointer by 1, but it halts the program instead.)\n\n\"With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the gravity assist, you need to determine what pair of inputs produces the output 19690720.\"\n\nThe inputs should still be provided to the program by replacing the values at addresses 1 and 2, just like before. In this program, the value placed in address 1 is called the noun, and the value placed in address 2 is called the verb. Each of the two input values will be between 0 and 99, inclusive.\n\nOnce the program has halted, its output is available at address 0, also just like before. Each time you try a pair of inputs, make sure you first reset the computer's memory to the values in the program (your puzzle input) - in other words, don't reuse memory from a previous attempt.\n\nFind the input noun and verb that cause the program to produce the output 19690720. What is 100 * noun + verb? (For example, if noun=12 and verb=2, the answer would be 1202.)\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule Day2 do\n  def read_input do\n    \"input.txt\"\n    |> File.read!()\n    |> String.trim()\n    |> String.split(\",\")\n    |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)\n  end\n\n  defp process_intcode(program), do: process_intcode(program, 0)\n\n  defp process_intcode(program, pointer) do\n    case Enum.slice(program, pointer, 4) do\n      [99 | _] ->\n        program\n\n      [opcode, pos_a, pos_b, pos_out] ->\n        new_program =\n          program\n          |> execute(opcode, pos_a, pos_b, pos_out)\n\n        process_intcode(new_program, pointer + 4)\n\n      _ ->\n        program\n    end\n  end\n\n  defp execute(program, 1, pos_a, pos_b, pos_out) do\n    result = Enum.at(program, pos_a) + Enum.at(program, pos_b)\n    List.replace_at(program, pos_out, result)\n  end\n\n  defp execute(program, 2, pos_a, pos_b, pos_out) do\n    result = Enum.at(program, pos_a) * Enum.at(program, pos_b)\n    List.replace_at(program, pos_out, result)\n  end\n\n  defp try_combinations(program, noun, verb) do\n    modified_program = List.replace_at(List.replace_at(program, 1, noun), 2, verb)\n    [head | _] = process_intcode(modified_program)\n    head\n  end\n\n  defp find_noun_verb(program, output) do\n    try do\n      for noun <- 0..99, verb <- 0..99 do\n        result = try_combinations(program, noun, verb)\n        if result == output, do: throw({noun, verb})\n      end\n    catch\n      :throw, {noun, verb} -> {noun, verb}\n    end\n  end\n\n  def call do\n    program = read_input()\n    {noun, verb} = find_noun_verb(program, 19_690_720)\n    IO.puts(100 * noun + verb)\n  end\nend\n\nDay2.call()\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

During the rush back on Earth, the fuel management system wasn't completely installed, so that's next on the priority list.\n\nOpening the front panel reveals a jumble of wires. Specifically, two wires are connected to a central port and extend outward on a grid. You trace the path each wire takes as it leaves the central port, one wire per line of text (your puzzle input).\n\nThe wires twist and turn, but the two wires occasionally cross paths. To fix the circuit, you need to find the intersection point closest to the central port. Because the wires are on a grid, use the Manhattan distance for this measurement.

The Elves suggest that you get the air conditioner working by upgrading your ship computer to support the Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal.\n\nThe Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal (TEST) starts by running a diagnostic program (your puzzle input). The TEST diagnostic program will run on your existing Intcode computer after a few modifications:\n\nFirst, you'll need to add two new instructions:\n\nOpcode 3 takes a single integer as input and saves it to the position given by its only parameter. For example, the instruction 3,50 would take an input value and store it at address 50.\nOpcode 4 outputs the value of its only parameter. For example, the instruction 4,50 would output the value at address 50.\nPrograms that use these instructions will come with documentation that explains what should be connected to the input and output. The program 3,0,4,0,99 outputs whatever it gets as input, then halts.\n\nSecond, you'll need to add support for parameter modes:\n\nEach parameter of an instruction is handled based on its parameter mode. Right now, your ship computer already understands parameter mode 0, position mode, which causes the parameter to be interpreted as a position - if the parameter is 50, its value is the value stored at address 50 in memory. Until now, all parameters have been in position mode.\n\nNow, your ship computer will also need to handle parameters in mode 1, immediate mode. In immediate mode, a parameter is interpreted as a value - if the parameter is 50, its value is simply 50.\n\nParameter modes are stored in the same value as the instruction's opcode. The opcode is a two-digit number based only on the ones and tens digit of the value, that is, the opcode is the rightmost two digits of the first value in an instruction. Parameter modes are single digits, one per parameter, read right-to-left from the opcode: the first parameter's mode is in the hundreds digit, the second parameter's mode is in the thousands digit, the third parameter's mode is in the ten-thousands digit, and so on. Any missing modes are 0.\n\nFor example, consider the program 1002,4,3,4,33.\n\nThe first instruction, 1002,4,3,4, is a multiply instruction - the rightmost two digits of the first value, 02, indicate opcode 2, multiplication. Then, going right to left, the parameter modes are 0 (hundreds digit), 1 (thousands digit), and 0 (ten-thousands digit, not present and therefore zero):\n\nABCDE\n 1002\n\nDE - two-digit opcode,      02 == opcode 2\n C - mode of 1st parameter,  0 == position mode\n B - mode of 2nd parameter,  1 == immediate mode\n A - mode of 3rd parameter,  0 == position mode,\n                                  omitted due to being a leading zero\nThis instruction multiplies its first two parameters. The first parameter, 4 in position mode, works like it did before - its value is the value stored at address 4 (33). The second parameter, 3 in immediate mode, simply has value 3. The result of this operation, 33 * 3 = 99, is written according to the third parameter, 4 in position mode, which also works like it did before - 99 is written to address 4.\n\nParameters that an instruction writes to will never be in immediate mode.\n\nFinally, some notes:\n\nIt is important to remember that the instruction pointer should increase by the number of values in the instruction after the instruction finishes. Because of the new instructions, this amount is no longer always 4.\nIntegers can be negative: 1101,100,-1,4,0 is a valid program (find 100 + -1, store the result in position 4).\nThe TEST diagnostic program will start by requesting from the user the ID of the system to test by running an input instruction - provide it 1, the ID for the ship's air conditioner unit.\n\nIt will then perform a series of diagnostic tests confirming that various parts of the Intcode computer, like parameter modes, function correctly. For each test, it will run an output instruction indicating how far the result of the test was from the expected value, where 0 means the test was successful. Non-zero outputs mean that a function is not working correctly; check the instructions that were run before the output instruction to see which one failed.\n\nFinally, the program will output a diagnostic code and immediately halt. This final output isn't an error; an output followed immediately by a halt means the program finished. If all outputs were zero except the diagnostic code, the diagnostic program ran successfully.\n\nAfter providing 1 to the only input instruction and passing all the tests, what diagnostic code does the program produce?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 14522484.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe air conditioner comes online! Its cold air feels good for a while, but then the TEST alarms start to go off. Since the air conditioner can't vent its heat anywhere but back into the spacecraft, it's actually making the air inside the ship warmer.\n\nInstead, you'll need to use the TEST to extend the thermal radiators. Fortunately, the diagnostic program (your puzzle input) is already equipped for this. Unfortunately, your Intcode computer is not.\n\nYour computer is only missing a few opcodes:\n\nOpcode 5 is jump-if-true: if the first parameter is non-zero, it sets the instruction pointer to the value from the second parameter. Otherwise, it does nothing.\nOpcode 6 is jump-if-false: if the first parameter is zero, it sets the instruction pointer to the value from the second parameter. Otherwise, it does nothing.\nOpcode 7 is less than: if the first parameter is less than the second parameter, it stores 1 in the position given by the third parameter. Otherwise, it stores 0.\nOpcode 8 is equals: if the first parameter is equal to the second parameter, it stores 1 in the position given by the third parameter. Otherwise, it stores 0.\nLike all instructions, these instructions need to support parameter modes as described above.\n\nNormally, after an instruction is finished, the instruction pointer increases by the number of values in that instruction. However, if the instruction modifies the instruction pointer, that value is used and the instruction pointer is not automatically increased.\n\nFor example, here are several programs that take one input, compare it to the value 8, and then produce one output:\n\n3,9,8,9,10,9,4,9,99,-1,8 - Using position mode, consider whether the input is equal to 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).\n3,9,7,9,10,9,4,9,99,-1,8 - Using position mode, consider whether the input is less than 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).\n3,3,1108,-1,8,3,4,3,99 - Using immediate mode, consider whether the input is equal to 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).\n3,3,1107,-1,8,3,4,3,99 - Using immediate mode, consider whether the input is less than 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).\nHere are some jump tests that take an input, then output 0 if the input was zero or 1 if the input was non-zero:\n\n3,12,6,12,15,1,13,14,13,4,13,99,-1,0,1,9 (using position mode)\n3,3,1105,-1,9,1101,0,0,12,4,12,99,1 (using immediate mode)\nHere's a larger example:\n\n3,21,1008,21,8,20,1005,20,22,107,8,21,20,1006,20,31,\n1106,0,36,98,0,0,1002,21,125,20,4,20,1105,1,46,104,\n999,1105,1,46,1101,1000,1,20,4,20,1105,1,46,98,99\nThe above example program uses an input instruction to ask for a single number. The program will then output 999 if the input value is below 8, output 1000 if the input value is equal to 8, or output 1001 if the input value is greater than 8.\n\nThis time, when the TEST diagnostic program runs its input instruction to get the ID of the system to test, provide it 5, the ID for the ship's thermal radiator controller. This diagnostic test suite only outputs one number, the diagnostic code.\n\nWhat is the diagnostic code for system ID 5?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule Intcode do\n  def call do\n    input = File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n            |> String.trim()\n            |> String.split(\",\")\n            |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)\n    process(input, 0, 5)\n  end\n\n  defp process(codes, pointer, input, output \\\\ nil)\n\n  defp process(codes, pointer, input, output) when is_list(codes) do\n    {opcode, mode1, mode2, _mode3} = decode(codes, pointer)\n    \n    case opcode do\n      1 -> process(apply_op(codes, pointer, mode1, mode2, &+/2), pointer + 4, input, output)\n      2 -> process(apply_op(codes, pointer, mode1, mode2, &*/2), pointer + 4, input, output)\n      3 -> process(update(codes, codes |> Enum.at(pointer + 1), input), pointer + 2, input, output)\n      4 -> process(codes, pointer + 2, input, get_param(codes, pointer + 1, mode1))\n      5 -> process(codes, jump_if(codes, pointer, mode1, mode2, &!=/2), input, output)\n      6 -> process(codes, jump_if(codes, pointer, mode1, mode2, &==/2), input, output)\n      7 -> process(apply_op(codes, pointer, mode1, mode2, &lt/2), pointer + 4, input, output)\n      8 -> process(apply_op(codes, pointer, mode1, mode2, &eq/2), pointer + 4, input, output)\n      99 -> output\n    end\n  end\n\n  defp decode(codes, pointer) do\n    opcode = Enum.at(codes, pointer) |> rem(100)\n    mode1 = Enum.at(codes, pointer) |> div(100) |> rem(10)\n    mode2 = Enum.at(codes, pointer) |> div(1000) |> rem(10)\n    mode3 = Enum.at(codes, pointer) |> div(10000) |> rem(10)\n    {opcode, mode1, mode2, mode3}\n  end\n\n  defp get_param(codes, index, mode) do\n    case mode do\n      0 -> Enum.at(codes, Enum.at(codes, index))\n      1 -> Enum.at(codes, index)\n    end\n  end\n\n  defp update(codes, index, value) do\n    List.replace_at(codes, index, value)\n  end\n\n  defp apply_op(codes, pointer, mode1, mode2, op) do\n    param1 = get_param(codes, pointer + 1, mode1)\n    param2 = get_param(codes, pointer + 2, mode2)\n    result = op.(param1, param2)\n    update(codes, Enum.at(codes, pointer + 3), result)\n  end\n\n  defp jump_if(codes, pointer, mode1, mode2, condition) do\n    param1 = get_param(codes, pointer + 1, mode1)\n    param2 = get_param(codes, pointer + 2, mode2)\n    if condition.(param1, 0), do: param2, else: pointer + 3\n  end\n\n  defp lt(a, b), do: if a < b, do: 1, else: 0\n  defp eq(a, b), do: if a == b, do: 1, else: 0\nend\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

Because navigation in space often involves transferring between orbits, the orbit maps here are useful for finding efficient routes between, for example, you and Santa. You download a map of the local orbits (your puzzle input).\n\nExcept for the universal Center of Mass (COM), every object in space is in orbit around exactly one other object. An orbit looks roughly like this:\n\n                                                         |\n                    |\nAAA--> o            o <--BBB\n                    |\n                    |\n                   /\n                  /\nIn this diagram, the object BBB is in orbit around AAA. The path that BBB takes around AAA (drawn with lines) is only partly shown. In the map data, this orbital relationship is written AAA)BBB, which means \"BBB is in orbit around AAA\".\n\nBefore you use your map data to plot a course, you need to make sure it wasn't corrupted during the download. To verify maps, the Universal Orbit Map facility uses orbit count checksums - the total number of direct orbits (like the one shown above) and indirect orbits.\n\nWhenever A orbits B and B orbits C, then A indirectly orbits C. This chain can be any number of objects long: if A orbits B, B orbits C, and C orbits D, then A indirectly orbits D.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following map:\n\nCOM)B\nB)C\nC)D\nD)E\nE)F\nB)G\nG)H\nD)I\nE)J\nJ)K\nK)L\nVisually, the above map of orbits looks like this:\n\n        G - H       J - K - L\n       /           /\nCOM - B - C - D - E - F\n                               I\nIn this visual representation, when two objects are connected by a line, the one on the right directly orbits the one on the left.\n\nHere, we can count the total number of orbits as follows:\n\nD directly orbits C and indirectly orbits B and COM, a total of 3 orbits.\nL directly orbits K and indirectly orbits J, E, D, C, B, and COM, a total of 7 orbits.\nCOM orbits nothing.\nThe total number of direct and indirect orbits in this example is 42.\n\nWhat is the total number of direct and indirect orbits in your map data?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule OrbitMap do\n  def call do\n    input = File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n    orbits = input |> String.split(\"\\n\") |> parse_orbits()\n\n    total_orbits(orbits)\n  end\n\n  defp parse_orbits(input) do\n    input\n    |> Enum.map(&String.split(&1, \")\"))\n    |> Enum.reduce(%{}, fn [center, orbit], acc ->\n      Map.update(acc, orbit, [center], &(&1 ++ [center]))\n    end)\n  end\n\n  defp total_orbits(orbits) do\n    orbits\n    |> Map.keys()\n    |> Enum.reduce(0, fn orbit, acc ->\n      acc + count_orbits(orbits, orbit)\n    end)\n  end\n\n  defp count_orbits(orbits, orbit) do\n    case orbits[orbit] do\n      nil -> 0\n      centers -> Enum.reduce(centers, 0, fn center, acc ->\n        acc + 1 + count_orbits(orbits, center)\n      end)\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

You land your ship near the rover.\n\nWhen you reach the rover, you discover that it's already in the process of rebooting! It's just waiting for someone to enter a BIOS password. The Elf responsible for the rover takes a picture of the password (your puzzle input) and sends it to you via the Digital Sending Network.\n\nUnfortunately, images sent via the Digital Sending Network aren't encoded with any normal encoding; instead, they're encoded in a special Space Image Format. None of the Elves seem to remember why this is the case. They send you the instructions to decode it.\n\nImages are sent as a series of digits that each represent the color of a single pixel. The digits fill each row of the image left-to-right, then move downward to the next row, filling rows top-to-bottom until every pixel of the image is filled.\n\nEach image actually consists of a series of identically-sized layers that are filled in this way. So, the first digit corresponds to the top-left pixel of the first layer, the second digit corresponds to the pixel to the right of that on the same layer, and so on until the last digit, which corresponds to the bottom-right pixel of the last layer.\n\nFor example, given an image 3 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall, the image data 123456789012 corresponds to the following image layers:\n\nLayer 1: 123\n         456\n\nLayer 2: 789\n         012\nThe image you received is 25 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall.\n\nTo make sure the image wasn't corrupted during transmission, the Elves would like you to find the layer that contains the fewest 0 digits.

While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.\n\nDue to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (.) and trees (#) you can see. For example:\n\n..##.......\n#...#...#..\n.#....#..#.\n..#.#...#.#\n.#...##..#.\n..#.##.....\n.#.#.#....#\n.#........#\n#.##...#...\n#...##....#\n.#..#...#.#\nThese aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to the right many times:\n\n..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->\n#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..\n.#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.\n..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#\n.#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.\n..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->\n.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#\n.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#\n#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...\n#...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#\n.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->\nYou start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).\n\nThe toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:\n\nFrom your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.\n\nThe locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree:\n\n..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->\n#..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..\n.#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.\n..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#\n.#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.\n..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->\n.#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#\n.#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#\n#.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...\n#...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....#\n.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->\nIn this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.\n\nStarting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule TobogganTrajectory do\n  def call do\n    input = File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n    map = String.split(input, \"\\n\", trim: true)\n\n    count_trees(map, 3, 1)\n  end\n\n  defp count_trees(map, right, down) do\n    {_, trees} = Enum.reduce(0..length(map) - 1, {0, 0}, fn i, {x, trees} ->\n      if rem(i, down) == 0 do\n        new_x = rem(x + right, String.length(Enum.at(map, i)))\n        new_trees = if String.at(Enum.at(map, i), x) == \"#\", do: trees + 1, else: trees\n        {new_x, new_trees}\n      else\n        {x, trees}\n      end\n    end)\n\n    trees\n  end\nend\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

While you consider checking the in-flight menu for one of those drinks that come with a little umbrella, you are interrupted by the kid sitting next to you.\n\nTheir handheld game console won't turn on! They ask if you can take a look.\n\nYou narrow the problem down to a strange infinite loop in the boot code (your puzzle input) of the device. You should be able to fix it, but first you need to be able to run the code in isolation.\n\nThe boot code is represented as a text file with one instruction per line of text. Each instruction consists of an operation (acc, jmp, or nop) and an argument (a signed number like +4 or -20).\n\nacc increases or decreases a single global value called the accumulator by the value given in the argument. For example, acc +7 would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator starts at 0. After an acc instruction, the instruction immediately below it is executed next.\njmp jumps to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an offset from the jmp instruction; for example, jmp +2 would skip the next instruction, jmp +1 would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and jmp -20 would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.\nnop stands for No OPeration - it does nothing. The instruction immediately below it is executed next.\nFor example, consider the following program:\n\nnop +0\nacc +1\njmp +4\nacc +3\njmp -3\nacc -99\nacc +1\njmp -4\nacc +6\nThese instructions are visited in this order:\n\nnop +0  | 1\nacc +1  | 2, 8(!)\njmp +4  | 3\nacc +3  | 6\njmp -3  | 7\nacc -99 |\nacc +1  | 4\njmp -4  | 5\nacc +6  |\nFirst, the nop +0 does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (acc +1) and jmp +4 sets the next instruction to the other acc +1 near the bottom. After it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, jmp -4 executes, setting the next instruction to the only acc +3. It sets the accumulator to 5, and jmp -3 causes the program to continue back at the first acc +1.\n\nThis is an infinite loop: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment the program tries to run any instruction a second time, you know it will never terminate.\n\nImmediately before the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the accumulator is 5.\n\nRun your copy of the boot code. Immediately before any instruction is executed a second time, what value is in the accumulator?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule Day8 do\n  def call do\n    input = File.read!(\"input.txt\") |> String.split(\"\\n\", trim: true)\n    execute_instructions(input, 0, 0, [])\n  end\n\n  defp execute_instructions(instructions, index, acc, visited) do\n    if index in visited do\n      acc\n    else\n      case Enum.at(instructions, index) do\n        \"nop \" <> _arg -> execute_instructions(instructions, index + 1, acc, [index | visited])\n        \"acc \" <> arg ->\n          acc_increment = String.to_integer(arg)\n          execute_instructions(instructions, index + 1, acc + acc_increment, [index | visited])\n        \"jmp \" <> arg ->\n          jump = String.to_integer(arg)\n          execute_instructions(instructions, index + jump, acc, [index | visited])\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

(That is, if the ship is facing east and the next instruction is N10, the ship would move north 10 units, but would still move east if the following action were F.)\n\nFor example:\n\nF10\nN3\nF7\nR90\nF11\nThese instructions would be handled as follows:\n\nF10 would move the ship 10 units east (because the ship starts by facing east) to east 10, north 0.\nN3 would move the ship 3 units north to east 10, north 3.\nF7 would move the ship another 7 units east (because the ship is still facing east) to east 17, north 3.\nR90 would cause the ship to turn right by 90 degrees and face south; it remains at east 17, north 3.\nF11 would move the ship 11 units south to east 17, south 8.\nAt the end of these instructions, the ship's Manhattan distance (sum of the absolute values of its east/west position and its north/south position) from its starting position is 17 + 8 = 25.\n\nFigure out where the navigation instructions lead. What is the Manhattan distance between that location and the ship's starting position?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 381.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nBefore you can give the destination to the captain, you realize that the actual action meanings were printed on the back of the instructions the whole time.\n\nAlmost all of the actions indicate how to move a waypoint which is relative to the ship's position:\n\nAction N means to move the waypoint north by the given value.\nAction S means to move the waypoint south by the given value.\nAction E means to move the waypoint east by the given value.\nAction W means to move the waypoint west by the given value.\nAction L means to rotate the waypoint around the ship left (counter-clockwise) the given number of degrees.\nAction R means to rotate the waypoint around the ship right (clockwise) the given number of degrees.\nAction F means to move forward to the waypoint a number of times equal to the given value.\nThe waypoint starts 10 units east and 1 unit north relative to the ship. The waypoint is relative to the ship; that is, if the ship moves, the waypoint moves with it.\n\nFor example, using the same instructions as above:\n\nF10 moves the ship to the waypoint 10 times (a total of 100 units east and 10 units north), leaving the ship at east 100, north 10. The waypoint stays 10 units east and 1 unit north of the ship.\nN3 moves the waypoint 3 units north to 10 units east and 4 units north of the ship. The ship remains at east 100, north 10.\nF7 moves the ship to the waypoint 7 times (a total of 70 units east and 28 units north), leaving the ship at east 170, north 38. The waypoint stays 10 units east and 4 units north of the ship.\nR90 rotates the waypoint around the ship clockwise 90 degrees, moving it to 4 units east and 10 units south of the ship. The ship remains at east 170, north 38.\nF11 moves the ship to the waypoint 11 times (a total of 44 units east and 110 units south), leaving the ship at east 214, south 72. The waypoint stays 4 units east and 10 units south of the ship.\nAfter these operations, the ship's Manhattan distance from its starting position is 214 + 72 = 286.\n\nFigure out where the navigation instructions actually lead. What is the Manhattan distance between that location and the ship's starting position?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule Day12 do\n  def read_input do\n    File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n    |> String.trim()\n    |> String.split(\"\\n\")\n    |> Enum.map(&parse_instruction/1)\n  end\n\n  defp parse_instruction(instruction) do\n    [action, value_string] = Regex.run(~r/^([NSEWLRF])(\\d+)$/, instruction, capture: :all_but_first)\n    {String.to_atom(action), String.to_integer(value_string)}\n  end\n\n  defp process_instructions(instructions) do\n    Enum.reduce(instructions, {{0, 0}, {10, 1}}, fn {action, value}, {{x, y}, {wx, wy}} ->\n      case action do\n        :N -> {{x, y}, {wx, wy + value}}\n        :S -> {{x, y}, {wx, wy - value}}\n        :E -> {{x, y}, {wx + value, wy}}\n        :W -> {{x, y}, {wx - value, wy}}\n        :L -> {{x, y}, rotate_waypoint({wx, wy}, -value)}\n        :R -> {{x, y}, rotate_waypoint({wx, wy}, value)}\n        :F -> {move_towards_waypoint({x, y}, {wx, wy}, value), {wx, wy}}\n      end\n    end)\n  end\n\n  defp rotate_waypoint({wx, wy}, degrees) do\n    case rem(degrees, 360) do\n      0 -> {wx, wy}\n      90 -> {wy, -wx}\n      180 -> {-wx, -wy}\n      270 -> {-wy, wx}\n      _ -> rotate_waypoint({wx, wy}, degrees + 360)\n    end\n  end\n\n  defp move_towards_waypoint({x, y}, {wx, wy}, value) do\n    {x + wx * value, y + wy * value}\n  end\n\n  def call do\n    instructions = read_input()\n    {{final_x, final_y}, _} = process_instructions(instructions)\n    manhattan_distance = abs(final_x) + abs(final_y)\n    IO.puts(\"Manhattan distance: #{manhattan_distance}\")\n  end\nend\n\nDay12.call()\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

(The first line in your input is no longer relevant.)\n\nFor example, suppose you have the same list of bus IDs as above:\n\n7,13,x,x,59,x,31,19\nAn x in the schedule means there are no constraints on what bus IDs must depart at that time.\n\nThis means you are looking for the earliest timestamp (called t) such that:\n\nBus ID 7 departs at timestamp t.\nBus ID 13 departs one minute after timestamp t.\nThere are no requirements or restrictions on departures at two or three minutes after timestamp t.\nBus ID 59 departs four minutes after timestamp t.\nThere are no requirements or restrictions on departures at five minutes after timestamp t.\nBus ID 31 departs six minutes after timestamp t.\nBus ID 19 departs seven minutes after timestamp t.\nThe only bus departures that matter are the listed bus IDs at their specific offsets from t. Those bus IDs can depart at other times, and other bus IDs can depart at those times.

The current bitmask is applied to values immediately before they are written to memory: a 0 or 1 overwrites the corresponding bit in the value, while an X leaves the bit in the value unchanged.\n\nFor example, consider the following program:\n\nmask = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nmem[8] = 11\nmem[7] = 101\nmem[8] = 0\nThis program starts by specifying a bitmask (mask = ....). The mask it specifies will overwrite two bits in every written value: the 2s bit is overwritten with 0, and the 64s bit is overwritten with 1.\n\nThe program then attempts to write the value 11 to memory address 8. By expanding everything out to individual bits, the mask is applied as follows:\n\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000000001011  (decimal 11)\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001001001  (decimal 73)\nSo, because of the mask, the value 73 is written to memory address 8 instead. Then, the program tries to write 101 to address 7:\n\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000001100101  (decimal 101)\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001100101  (decimal 101)\nThis time, the mask has no effect, as the bits it overwrote were already the values the mask tried to set. Finally, the program tries to write 0 to address 8:\n\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000000000000  (decimal 0)\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001000000  (decimal 64)\n64 is written to address 8 instead, overwriting the value that was there previously.\n\nTo initialize your ferry's docking program, you need the sum of all values left in memory after the initialization program completes. (The entire 36-bit address space begins initialized to the value 0 at every address.) In the above example, only two values in memory are not zero - 101 (at address 7) and 64 (at address 8) - producing a sum of 165.\n\nExecute the initialization program. What is the sum of all values left in memory after it completes? (Do not truncate the sum to 36 bits.)\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule Day14 do\n  def read_input do\n    File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n    |> String.trim()\n    |> String.split(\"\\n\")\n    |> Enum.map(&parse_instruction/1)\n  end\n\n  defp parse_instruction(\"mask = \" <> mask) do\n    {:mask, mask}\n  end\n\n  defp parse_instruction(instruction) do\n    [mem, value] = Regex.run(~r/mem\\[(\\d+)\\] = (\\d+)/, instruction, capture: :all_but_first)\n    {:mem, String.to_integer(mem), String.to_integer(value)}\n  end\n\n  defp apply_mask(value, mask) do\n    value_binary = Integer.to_string(value, 2) |> String.pad_leading(36, \"0\")\n\n    Enum.zip(String.graphemes(value_binary), String.graphemes(mask))\n    |> Enum.map(fn {v, m} -> if m == \"X\", do: v, else: m end)\n    |> Enum.join(\"\")\n    |> String.to_integer(2)\n  end\n\n  defp process_instructions(instructions) do\n    Enum.reduce(instructions, {%{}, \"\"}, fn\n      {:mask, mask}, {mem, _} ->\n        {mem, mask}\n\n      {:mem, address, value}, {mem, mask} ->\n        new_value = apply_mask(value, mask)\n        {Map.put(mem, address, new_value), mask}\n    end)\n    |> elem(0)\n  end\n\n  def call do\n    instructions = read_input()\n    memory = process_instructions(instructions)\n    sum = Enum.reduce(memory, 0, fn {_k, v}, acc -> acc + v end)\n    IO.puts(sum)\n  end\nend\n\nDay14.call()\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

The computer system that runs this port isn't compatible with the docking program on the ferry, so the docking parameters aren't being correctly initialized in the docking program's memory.\n\nAfter a brief inspection, you discover that the sea port's computer system uses a strange bitmask system in its initialization program. Although you don't have the correct decoder chip handy, you can emulate it in software!\n\nThe initialization program (your puzzle input) can either update the bitmask or write a value to memory. Values and memory addresses are both 36-bit unsigned integers. For example, ignoring bitmasks for a moment, a line like mem[8] = 11 would write the value 11 to memory address 8.\n\nThe bitmask is always given as a string of 36 bits, written with the most significant bit (representing 2^35) on the left and the least significant bit (2^0, that is, the 1s bit) on the right. The current bitmask is applied to values immediately before they are written to memory: a 0 or 1 overwrites the corresponding bit in the value, while an X leaves the bit in the value unchanged.\n\nFor example, consider the following program:\n\nmask = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nmem[8] = 11\nmem[7] = 101\nmem[8] = 0\nThis program starts by specifying a bitmask (mask = ....). The mask it specifies will overwrite two bits in every written value: the 2s bit is overwritten with 0, and the 64s bit is overwritten with 1.\n\nThe program then attempts to write the value 11 to memory address 8. By expanding everything out to individual bits, the mask is applied as follows:\n\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000000001011  (decimal 11)\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001001001  (decimal 73)\nSo, because of the mask, the value 73 is written to memory address 8 instead. Then, the program tries to write 101 to address 7:\n\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000001100101  (decimal 101)\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001100101  (decimal 101)\nThis time, the mask has no effect, as the bits it overwrote were already the values the mask tried to set. Finally, the program tries to write 0 to address 8:\n\nvalue:  000000000000000000000000000000000000  (decimal 0)\nmask:   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1XXXX0X\nresult: 000000000000000000000000000001000000  (decimal 64)\n64 is written to address 8 instead, overwriting the value that was there previously.\n\nTo initialize your ferry's docking program, you need the sum of all values left in memory after the initialization program completes. (The entire 36-bit address space begins initialized to the value 0 at every address.) In the above example, only two values in memory are not zero - 101 (at address 7) and 64 (at address 8) - producing a sum of 165.\n\nExecute the initialization program. What is the sum of all values left in memory after it completes? (Do not truncate the sum to 36 bits.)\n\nYour puzzle answer was 8471403462063.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nFor some reason, the sea port's computer system still can't communicate with your ferry's docking program. It must be using version 2 of the decoder chip!\n\nA version 2 decoder chip doesn't modify the values being written at all. Instead, it acts as a memory address decoder. Immediately before a value is written to memory, each bit in the bitmask modifies the corresponding bit of the destination memory address in the following way:\n\nIf the bitmask bit is 0, the corresponding memory address bit is unchanged.\nIf the bitmask bit is 1, the corresponding memory address bit is overwritten with 1.\nIf the bitmask bit is X, the corresponding memory address bit is floating.\nA floating bit is not connected to anything and instead fluctuates unpredictably. In practice, this means the floating bits will take on all possible values, potentially causing many memory addresses to be written all at once!\n\nFor example, consider the following program:\n\nmask = 000000000000000000000000000000X1001X\nmem[42] = 100\nmask = 00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX\nmem[26] = 1\nWhen this program goes to write to memory address 42, it first applies the bitmask:\n\naddress: 000000000000000000000000000000101010  (decimal 42)\nmask:    000000000000000000000000000000X1001X\nresult:  000000000000000000000000000000X1101X\nAfter applying the mask, four bits are overwritten, three of which are different, and two of which are floating. Floating bits take on every possible combination of values; with two floating bits, four actual memory addresses are written:\n\n000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)\n000000000000000000000000000000011011  (decimal 27)\n000000000000000000000000000000111010  (decimal 58)\n000000000000000000000000000000111011  (decimal 59)\nNext, the program is about to write to memory address 26 with a different bitmask:\n\naddress: 000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)\nmask:    00000000000000000000000000000000X0XX\nresult:  00000000000000000000000000000001X0XX\nThis results in an address with three floating bits, causing writes to eight memory addresses:\n\n000000000000000000000000000000010000  (decimal 16)\n000000000000000000000000000000010001  (decimal 17)\n000000000000000000000000000000010010  (decimal 18)\n000000000000000000000000000000010011  (decimal 19)\n000000000000000000000000000000011000  (decimal 24)\n000000000000000000000000000000011001  (decimal 25)\n000000000000000000000000000000011010  (decimal 26)\n000000000000000000000000000000011011  (decimal 27)\nThe entire 36-bit address space still begins initialized to the value 0 at every address, and you still need the sum of all values left in memory at the end of the program. In this example, the sum is 208.\n\nExecute the initialization program using an emulator for a version 2 decoder chip.

However, the train ticket you were given is in a language you don't understand. You should probably figure out what it says before you get to the train station after the next flight.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't actually read the words on the ticket. You can, however, read the numbers, and so you figure out the fields these tickets must have and the valid ranges for values in those fields.\n\nYou collect the rules for ticket fields, the numbers on your ticket, and the numbers on other nearby tickets for the same train service (via the airport security cameras) together into a single document you can reference (your puzzle input).\n\nThe rules for ticket fields specify a list of fields that exist somewhere on the ticket and the valid ranges of values for each field. For example, a rule like class: 1-3 or 5-7 means that one of the fields in every ticket is named class and can be any value in the ranges 1-3 or 5-7 (inclusive, such that 3 and 5 are both valid in this field, but 4 is not).\n\nEach ticket is represented by a single line of comma-separated values. The values are the numbers on the ticket in the order they appear; every ticket has the same format. For example, consider this ticket:\n\n.--------------------------------------------------------.\n| ????: 101    ?????: 102   ??????????: 103     ???: 104 |\n|                                                        |\n| ??: 301  ??: 302             ???????: 303      ??????? |\n| ??: 401  ??: 402           ???? ????: 403    ????????? |\n'--------------------------------------------------------'\nHere, ? represents text in a language you don't understand. This ticket might be represented as 101,102,103,104,301,302,303,401,402,403; of course, the actual train tickets you're looking at are much more complicated. In any case, you've extracted just the numbers in such a way that the first number is always the same specific field, the second number is always a different specific field, and so on - you just don't know what each position actually means!\n\nStart by determining which tickets are completely invalid; these are tickets that contain values which aren't valid for any field. Ignore your ticket for now.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following notes:\n\nclass: 1-3 or 5-7\nrow: 6-11 or 33-44\nseat: 13-40 or 45-50\n\nyour ticket:\n7,1,14\n\nnearby tickets:\n7,3,47\n40,4,50\n55,2,20\n38,6,12\nIt doesn't matter which position corresponds to which field; you can identify invalid nearby tickets by considering only whether tickets contain values that are not valid for any field. In this example, the values on the first nearby ticket are all valid for at least one field. This is not true of the other three nearby tickets: the values 4, 55, and 12 are are not valid for any field. Adding together all of the invalid values produces your ticket scanning error rate: 4 + 55 + 12 = 71.\n\nConsider the validity of the nearby tickets you scanned. What is your ticket scanning error rate?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule Day16 do\n  def read_input do\n    [rules, _your_ticket, nearby_tickets] =\n      File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n      |> String.trim()\n      |> String.split(\"\\n\\n\")\n\n    {parse_rules(rules), parse_tickets(nearby_tickets)}\n  end\n\n  defp parse_rules(rules) do\n    Enum.map(String.split(rules, \"\\n\"), fn rule ->\n      [_, ranges] = String.split(rule, \": \")\n      Enum.map(String.split(ranges, \" or \"), fn range ->\n        [min, max] = String.split(range, \"-\")\n        {String.to_integer(min), String.to_integer(max)}\n      end)\n    end)\n    |> List.flatten()\n  end\n\n  defp parse_tickets(tickets) do\n    tickets\n    |> String.split(\"\\n\", trim: true)\n    |> Enum.drop(1)\n    |> Enum.map(fn ticket ->\n      ticket\n      |> String.split(\",\")\n      |> Enum.map(fn value -> String.to_integer(value) end)\n    end)\n  end\n\n  defp invalid_values(tickets, rules) do\n    Enum.flat_map(tickets, fn ticket ->\n      Enum.filter(ticket, fn value ->\n        Enum.all?(rules, fn {min, max} ->\n          value < min or value > max\n        end)\n      end)\n    end)\n  end\n\n  def call do\n    {rules, nearby_tickets} = read_input()\n    error_rate = invalid_values(nearby_tickets, rules) |> Enum.sum()\n    IO.puts(\"Ticket scanning error rate: #{error_rate}\")\n  end\nend\n\nDay16.call()\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

As you walk to your high-speed train, the Elves at the Mythical Information Bureau contact you again. They think their satellite has collected an image of a sea monster! Unfortunately, the connection to the satellite is having problems, and many of the messages sent back from the satellite have been corrupted.\n\nThey sent you a list of the rules valid messages should obey and a list of received messages they've collected so far (your puzzle input).\n\nThe rules for valid messages (the top part of your puzzle input) are numbered and build upon each other. For example:\n\n0: 1 2\n1: \"a\"\n2: 1 3 | 3 1\n3: \"b\"\nSome rules, like 3: \"b\", simply match a single character (in this case, b).\n\nThe remaining rules list the sub-rules that must be followed; for example, the rule 0: 1 2 means that to match rule 0, the text being checked must match rule 1, and the text after the part that matched rule 1 must then match rule 2.\n\nSome of the rules have multiple lists of sub-rules separated by a pipe (|). This means that at least one list of sub-rules must match. (The ones that match might be different each time the rule is encountered.) For example, the rule 2: 1 3 | 3 1 means that to match rule 2, the text being checked must match rule 1 followed by rule 3 or it must match rule 3 followed by rule 1.\n\nFortunately, there are no loops in the rules, so the list of possible matches will be finite. Since rule 1 matches a and rule 3 matches b, rule 2 matches either ab or ba. Therefore, rule 0 matches aab or aba.\n\nHere's a more interesting example:\n\n0: 4 1 5\n1: 2 3 | 3 2\n2: 4 4 | 5 5\n3: 4 5 | 5 4\n4: \"a\"\n5: \"b\"\nHere, because rule 4 matches a and rule 5 matches b, rule 2 matches two letters that are the same (aa or bb), and rule 3 matches two letters that are different (ab or ba).\n\nSince rule 1 matches rules 2 and 3 once each in either order, it must match two pairs of letters, one pair with matching letters and one pair with different letters. This leaves eight possibilities: aaab, aaba, bbab, bbba, abaa, abbb, baaa, or babb.\n\nRule 0, therefore, matches a (rule 4), then any of the eight options from rule 1, then b (rule 5): aaaabb, aaabab, abbabb, abbbab, aabaab, aabbbb, abaaab, or ababbb.\n\nThe received messages (the bottom part of your puzzle input) need to be checked against the rules so you can determine which are valid and which are corrupted. Including the rules and the messages together, this might look like:\n\n0: 4 1 5\n1: 2 3 | 3 2\n2: 4 4 | 5 5\n3: 4 5 | 5 4\n4: \"a\"\n5: \"b\"\n\nababbb\nbababa\nabbbab\naaabbb\naaaabbb\nYour goal is to determine the number of messages that completely match rule 0. In the above example, ababbb and abbbab match, but bababa, aaabbb, and aaaabbb do not, producing the answer 2. The whole message must match all of rule 0; there can't be extra unmatched characters in the message. (For example, aaaabbb might appear to match rule 0 above, but it has an extra unmatched b on the end.)\n\nHow many messages completely match rule 0?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule MonsterMessages do\n  def call do\n    input = File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n    {rules, messages} = String.split(input, \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    rules_map = parse_rules(rules)\n    valid_messages = count_valid_messages(rules_map, messages)\n\n    valid_messages\n  end\n\n  defp parse_rules(rules) do\n    rules\n    |> String.split(\"\\n\")\n    |> Enum.reduce(%{}, fn rule, acc ->\n      [rule_id, rule_body] = String.split(rule, \": \")\n      acc |> Map.put(rule_id, rule_body)\n    end)\n  end\n\n  defp count_valid_messages(rules_map, messages) do\n    messages\n    |> String.split(\"\\n\")\n    |> Enum.count(fn message ->\n      Regex.match?(~r/\\A#{expand_rule(rules_map, \"0\")}\\z/, message)\n    end)\n  end\n\n  defp expand_rule(rules_map, rule_id) do\n    rule = Map.get(rules_map, rule_id)\n\n    if String.contains?(rule, \"|\") do\n      [left, right] = String.split(rule, \" | \")\n      \"(?:#{expand_subrule(rules_map, left)}|#{expand_subrule(rules_map, right)})\"\n    else\n      expand_subrule(rules_map, rule)\n    end\n  end\n\n  defp expand_subrule(rules_map, subrule) do\n    Enum.reduce(String.split(subrule), \"\", fn part, acc ->\n      if part in [\"a\", \"b\"] do\n        acc <> part\n      else\n        acc <> \"(?:\" <> expand_rule(rules_map, part) <> \")\"\n      end\n    end)\n  end\nend\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

Unfortunately, their registration systems are currently offline, and they cannot check you in. Noticing the look on your face, they quickly add that tech support is already on the way! They even created all the room keys this morning; you can take yours now and give them your room deposit once the registration system comes back online.\n\nThe room key is a small RFID card. Your room is on the 25th floor and the elevators are also temporarily out of service, so it takes what little energy you have left to even climb the stairs and navigate the halls. You finally reach the door to your room, swipe your card, and - beep - the light turns red.\n\nExamining the card more closely, you discover a phone number for tech support.\n\n\"Hello! How can we help you today?\" You explain the situation.\n\n\"Well, it sounds like the card isn't sending the right command to unlock the door. If you go back to the check-in desk, surely someone there can reset it for you.\" Still catching your breath, you describe the status of the elevator and the exact number of stairs you just had to climb.\n\n\"I see! Well, your only other option would be to reverse-engineer the cryptographic handshake the card does with the door and then inject your own commands into the data stream, but that's definitely impossible.\" You thank them for their time.\n\nUnfortunately for the door, you know a thing or two about cryptographic handshakes.\n\nThe handshake used by the card and the door involves an operation that transforms a subject number. To transform a subject number, start with the value 1. Then, a number of times called the loop size, perform the following steps:\n\nSet the value to itself multiplied by the subject number.\nSet the value to the remainder after dividing the value by 20201227.\nThe card always uses a specific, secret loop size when it transforms a subject number. The door always uses a different, secret loop size.\n\nThe cryptographic handshake works like this:\n\nThe card transforms the subject number of 7 according to the card's secret loop size. The result is called the card's public key.\nThe door transforms the subject number of 7 according to the door's secret loop size. The result is called the door's public key.\nThe card and door use the wireless RFID signal to transmit the two public keys (your puzzle input) to the other device. Now, the card has the door's public key, and the door has the card's public key. Because you can eavesdrop on the signal, you have both public keys, but neither device's loop size.\nThe card transforms the subject number of the door's public key according to the card's loop size. The result is the encryption key.\nThe door transforms the subject number of the card's public key according to the door's loop size. The result is the same encryption key as the card calculated.\nIf you can use the two public keys to determine each device's loop size, you will have enough information to calculate the secret encryption key that the card and door use to communicate; this would let you send the unlock command directly to the door!\n\nFor example, suppose you know that the card's public key is 5764801. With a little trial and error, you can work out that the card's loop size must be 8, because transforming the initial subject number of 7 with a loop size of 8 produces 5764801.\n\nThen, suppose you know that the door's public key is 17807724. By the same process, you can determine that the door's loop size is 11, because transforming the initial subject number of 7 with a loop size of 11 produces 17807724.\n\nAt this point, you can use either device's loop size with the other device's public key to calculate the encryption key. Transforming the subject number of 17807724 (the door's public key) with a loop size of 8 (the card's loop size) produces the encryption key, 14897079. (Transforming the subject number of 5764801 (the card's public key) with a loop size of 11 (the door's loop size) produces the same encryption key: 14897079.)\n\nWhat encryption key is the handshake trying to establish?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule Day25 do\n  @subject_number 7\n  @modulus 20201227\n\n  def read_input do\n    {card_public_key, door_public_key} =\n      File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n      |> String.trim()\n      |> String.split(\"\\n\")\n      |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)\n      |> List.to_tuple()\n\n    {card_public_key, door_public_key}\n  end\n\n  defp transform(subject_number, loop_size) do\n    Enum.reduce(1..loop_size, 1, fn _i, value ->\n      rem(value * subject_number, @modulus)\n    end)\n  end\n\n  defp find_loop_size(target_public_key) do\n    find_loop_size(1, 0, target_public_key)\n  end\n\n  defp find_loop_size(value, loop_size, target_public_key) when value == target_public_key do\n    loop_size\n  end\n\n  defp find_loop_size(value, loop_size, target_public_key) do\n    new_value = rem(value * @subject_number, @modulus)\n    find_loop_size(new_value, loop_size + 1, target_public_key)\n  end\n\n  def call do\n    {card_public_key, door_public_key} = read_input()\n\n    card_loop_size = find_loop_size(card_public_key)\n    # Alternatively, find door_loop_size and use card_public_key\n    encryption_key = transform(door_public_key, card_loop_size)\n\n    IO.puts(\"Encryption key: #{encryption_key}\")\n  end\nend\n\nDay25.call()\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

Good luck!\n\nAs the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar sweep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.\n\nFor example, suppose you had the following report:\n\n199\n200\n208\n210\n200\n207\n240\n269\n260\n263\nThis report indicates that, scanning outward from the submarine, the sonar sweep found depths of 199, 200, 208, 210, and so on.\n\nThe first order of business is to figure out how quickly the depth increases, just so you know what you're dealing with - you never know if the keys will get carried into deeper water by an ocean current or a fish or something.\n\nTo do this, count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement. (There is no measurement before the first measurement.) In the example above, the changes are as follows:\n\n199 (N/A - no previous measurement)\n200 (increased)\n208 (increased)\n210 (increased)\n200 (decreased)\n207 (increased)\n240 (increased)\n269 (increased)\n260 (decreased)\n263 (increased)\nIn this example, there are 7 measurements that are larger than the previous measurement.\n\nHow many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 1766.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nConsidering every single measurement isn't as useful as you expected: there's just too much noise in the data.\n\nInstead, consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window. Again considering the above example:\n\n199  A      \n200  A B    \n208  A B C  \n210    B C D\n200  E   C D\n207  E F   D\n240  E F G  \n269    F G H\n260      G H\n263        H\nStart by comparing the first and second three-measurement windows. The measurements in the first window are marked A (199, 200, 208); their sum is 199 + 200 + 208 = 607. The second window is marked B (200, 208, 210); its sum is 618. The sum of measurements in the second window is larger than the sum of the first, so this first comparison increased.\n\nYour goal now is to count the number of times the sum of measurements in this sliding window increases from the previous sum. So, compare A with B, then compare B with C, then C with D, and so on. Stop when there aren't enough measurements left to create a new three-measurement sum.\n\nIn the above example, the sum of each three-measurement window is as follows:\n\nA: 607 (N/A - no previous sum)\nB: 618 (increased)\nC: 618 (no change)\nD: 617 (decreased)\nE: 647 (increased)\nF: 716 (increased)\nG: 769 (increased)\nH: 792 (increased)\nIn this example, there are 5 sums that are larger than the previous sum.\n\nConsider sums of a three-measurement sliding window. How many sums are larger than the previous sum?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule SonarSweep do\n  def call do\n    input = File.read!(\"input.txt\") |> String.split(\"\\n\") |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)\n    {count_increases(input), count_increasing_sums(input)}\n  end\n\n  defp count_increases(input) do\n    Enum.reduce(input, {0, nil}, fn depth, {count, prev} ->\n      case prev do\n        nil -> {count, depth}\n        _ when depth > prev -> {count + 1, depth}\n        _ -> {count, depth}\n      end\n    end) |> elem(0)\n  end\n\n  defp count_increasing_sums(input) do\n    Enum.chunk_every(input, 3, 1, :discard) \n    |> Enum.map(&Enum.sum(&1))\n    |> count_increases()\n  end\nend\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

The first parameter to check is the power consumption.\n\nYou need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary numbers (called the gamma rate and the epsilon rate).

Both values are located using a similar process that involves filtering out values until only one remains. Before searching for either rating value, start with the full list of binary numbers from your diagnostic report and consider just the first bit of those numbers. Then:\n\nKeep only numbers selected by the bit criteria for the type of rating value for which you are searching. Discard numbers which do not match the bit criteria.\nIf you only have one number left, stop; this is the rating value for which you are searching.\nOtherwise, repeat the process, considering the next bit to the right.\nThe bit criteria depends on which type of rating value you want to find:\n\nTo find oxygen generator rating, determine the most common value (0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 1 in the position being considered.\nTo find CO2 scrubber rating, determine the least common value (0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 0 in the position being considered.\nFor example, to determine the oxygen generator rating value using the same example diagnostic report from above:\n\nStart with all 12 numbers and consider only the first bit of each number. There are more 1 bits (7) than 0 bits (5), so keep only the 7 numbers with a 1 in the first position: 11110, 10110, 10111, 10101, 11100, 10000, and 11001.\nThen, consider the second bit of the 7 remaining numbers: there are more 0 bits (4) than 1 bits (3), so keep only the 4 numbers with a 0 in the second position: 10110, 10111, 10101, and 10000.\nIn the third position, three of the four numbers have a 1, so keep those three: 10110, 10111, and 10101.\nIn the fourth position, two of the three numbers have a 1, so keep those two: 10110 and 10111.\nIn the fifth position, there are an equal number of 0 bits and 1 bits (one each). So, to find the oxygen generator rating, keep the number with a 1 in that position: 10111.\nAs there is only one number left, stop; the oxygen generator rating is 10111, or 23 in decimal.\nThen, to determine the CO2 scrubber rating value from the same example above:\n\nStart again with all 12 numbers and consider only the first bit of each number. There are fewer 0 bits (5) than 1 bits (7), so keep only the 5 numbers with a 0 in the first position: 00100, 01111, 00111, 00010, and 01010.\nThen, consider the second bit of the 5 remaining numbers: there are fewer 1 bits (2) than 0 bits (3), so keep only the 2 numbers with a 1 in the second position: 01111 and 01010.\nIn the third position, there are an equal number of 0 bits and 1 bits (one each). So, to find the CO2 scrubber rating, keep the number with a 0 in that position: 01010.\nAs there is only one number left, stop; the CO2 scrubber rating is 01010, or 10 in decimal.\nFinally, to find the life support rating, multiply the oxygen generator rating (23) by the CO2 scrubber rating (10) to get 230.\n\nUse the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the oxygen generator rating and CO2 scrubber rating, then multiply them together.

What you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.\n\nMaybe it wants to play bingo?\n\nBingo is played on a set of boards each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers.

That way, no matter which boards it picks, it will win for sure.\n\nIn the above example, the second board is the last to win, which happens after 13 is eventually called and its middle column is completely marked. If you were to keep playing until this point, the second board would have a sum of unmarked numbers equal to 148 for a final score of 148 * 13 = 1924.\n\nFigure out which board will win last.

In other words:\n\nAn entry like 1,1 -> 3,3 covers points 1,1, 2,2, and 3,3.\nAn entry like 9,7 -> 7,9 covers points 9,7, 8,8, and 7,9.\nConsidering all lines from the above example would now produce the following diagram:\n\n1.1....11.\n.111...2..\n..2.1.111.\n...1.2.2..\n.112313211\n...1.2....\n..1...1...\n.1.....1..\n1.......1.\n222111....\nYou still need to determine the number of points where at least two lines overlap.

Parts are even still volcanically active; small hydrothermal vents release smoke into the caves that slowly settles like rain.\n\nIf you can model how the smoke flows through the caves, you might be able to avoid it and be that much safer. The submarine generates a heightmap of the floor of the nearby caves for you (your puzzle input).\n\nSmoke flows to the lowest point of the area it's in. For example, consider the following heightmap:\n\n2199943210\n3987894921\n9856789892\n8767896789\n9899965678\nEach number corresponds to the height of a particular location, where 9 is the highest and 0 is the lowest a location can be.\n\nYour first goal is to find the low points - the locations that are lower than any of its adjacent locations. Most locations have four adjacent locations (up, down, left, and right); locations on the edge or corner of the map have three or two adjacent locations, respectively. (Diagonal locations do not count as adjacent.)\n\nIn the above example, there are four low points, all highlighted: two are in the first row (a 1 and a 0), one is in the third row (a 5), and one is in the bottom row (also a 5). All other locations on the heightmap have some lower adjacent location, and so are not low points.\n\nThe risk level of a low point is 1 plus its height. In the above example, the risk levels of the low points are 2, 1, 6, and 6. The sum of the risk levels of all low points in the heightmap is therefore 15.\n\nFind all of the low points on your heightmap.

Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.\n\nHowever, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they've noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).\n\nFor example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:\n\n2-4,6-8\n2-3,4-5\n5-7,7-9\n2-8,3-7\n6-6,4-6\n2-6,4-8\nFor the first few pairs, this list means:\n\nWithin the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8).\nThe Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.\nThe Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9.\nThis example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:\n\n.234.....  2-4\n.....678.  6-8\n\n.23......  2-3\n...45....  4-5\n\n....567..  5-7\n......789  7-9\n\n.2345678.  2-8\n..34567..  3-7\n\n.....6...  6-6\n...456...  4-6\n\n.23456...  2-6\n...45678.  4-8\nSome of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other. For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained by 4-6. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration. In this example, there are 2 such pairs.\n\nIn how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule CampCleanup do\n  def call do\n    input = File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n    pairs = String.split(input, \"\\n\")\n\n    count = Enum.count(pairs, fn pair ->\n      [range1, range2] = String.split(pair, \",\")\n      [start1, end1] = String.split(range1, \"-\") |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)\n      [start2, end2] = String.split(range2, \"-\") |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)\n\n      (start1 <= start2 && end1 >= end2) || (start2 <= start1 && end2 >= end1)\n    end)\n\n    count\n  end\nend\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.\n\nHowever, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they've noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).\n\nFor example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:\n\n2-4,6-8\n2-3,4-5\n5-7,7-9\n2-8,3-7\n6-6,4-6\n2-6,4-8\nFor the first few pairs, this list means:\n\nWithin the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8).\nThe Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.\nThe Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9.\nThis example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:\n\n.234.....  2-4\n.....678.  6-8\n\n.23......  2-3\n...45....  4-5\n\n....567..  5-7\n......789  7-9\n\n.2345678.  2-8\n..34567..  3-7\n\n.....6...  6-6\n...456...  4-6\n\n.23456...  2-6\n...45678.  4-8\nSome of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other. For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained by 4-6. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration. In this example, there are 2 such pairs.\n\nIn how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 526.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nIt seems like there is still quite a bit of duplicate work planned. Instead, the Elves would like to know the number of pairs that overlap at all.\n\nIn the above example, the first two pairs (2-4,6-8 and 2-3,4-5) don't overlap, while the remaining four pairs (5-7,7-9, 2-8,3-7, 6-6,4-6, and 2-6,4-8) do overlap:\n\n5-7,7-9 overlaps in a single section, 7.\n2-8,3-7 overlaps all of the sections 3 through 7.\n6-6,4-6 overlaps in a single section, 6.\n2-6,4-8 overlaps in sections 4, 5, and 6.\nSo, in this example, the number of overlapping assignment pairs is 4.\n\nIn how many assignment pairs do the ranges overlap?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule CampCleanup do\n  def call do\n    input = File.read!(\"input.txt\") |> String.trim() |> String.split(\"\\n\")\n\n    fully_contained_count = Enum.count(input, fn line ->\n      [range1, range2] = String.split(line, \",\")\n      [start1, end1] = String.split(range1, \"-\") |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)\n      [start2, end2] = String.split(range2, \"-\") |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)\n\n      (start1 <= start2 && end1 >= end2) || (start1 >= start2 && end1 <= end2)\n    end)\n\n    overlaps_count = Enum.count(input, fn line ->\n      [range1, range2] = String.split(line, \",\")\n      [start1, end1] = String.split(range1, \"-\") |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)\n      [start2, end2] = String.split(range2, \"-\") |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)\n\n      start1 <= end2 && start2 <= end1\n    end)\n\n    overlaps_count\n  end\nend\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

You're worried they're going to try to steal your stuff again, but it seems like they're just holding their ground and making various monkey noises at you.\n\nEventually, one of the elephants realizes you don't speak monkey and comes over to interpret. As it turns out, they overheard you talking about trying to find the grove; they can show you a shortcut if you answer their riddle.\n\nEach monkey is given a job: either to yell a specific number or to yell the result of a math operation. All of the number-yelling monkeys know their number from the start; however, the math operation monkeys need to wait for two other monkeys to yell a number, and those two other monkeys might also be waiting on other monkeys.\n\nYour job is to work out the number the monkey named root will yell before the monkeys figure it out themselves.\n\nFor example:\n\nroot: pppw + sjmn\ndbpl: 5\ncczh: sllz + lgvd\nzczc: 2\nptdq: humn - dvpt\ndvpt: 3\nlfqf: 4\nhumn: 5\nljgn: 2\nsjmn: drzm * dbpl\nsllz: 4\npppw: cczh / lfqf\nlgvd: ljgn * ptdq\ndrzm: hmdt - zczc\nhmdt: 32\nEach line contains the name of a monkey, a colon, and then the job of that monkey:\n\nA lone number means the monkey's job is simply to yell that number.\nA job like aaaa + bbbb means the monkey waits for monkeys aaaa and bbbb to yell each of their numbers; the monkey then yells the sum of those two numbers.\naaaa - bbbb means the monkey yells aaaa's number minus bbbb's number.\nJob aaaa * bbbb will yell aaaa's number multiplied by bbbb's number.\nJob aaaa / bbbb will yell aaaa's number divided by bbbb's number.\nSo, in the above example, monkey drzm has to wait for monkeys hmdt and zczc to yell their numbers. Fortunately, both hmdt and zczc have jobs that involve simply yelling a single number, so they do this immediately: 32 and 2. Monkey drzm can then yell its number by finding 32 minus 2: 30.\n\nThen, monkey sjmn has one of its numbers (30, from monkey drzm), and already has its other number, 5, from dbpl. This allows it to yell its own number by finding 30 multiplied by 5: 150.\n\nThis process continues until root yells a number: 152.\n\nHowever, your actual situation involves considerably more monkeys. What number will the monkey named root yell?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule MonkeyMath do\n  def call do\n    input = File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n    monkey_jobs = input |> String.split(\"\\n\") |> Enum.map(&String.split(&1, \": \"))\n    monkey_numbers = Map.new(monkey_jobs, fn [name, job] -> {name, job} end)\n\n    calculate(monkey_numbers, \"root\")\n  end\n\n  defp calculate(monkey_numbers, name) do\n    job = Map.get(monkey_numbers, name)\n\n    case String.split(job, \" \") do\n      [number] -> String.to_integer(number)\n      [op1, \"+\", op2] -> calculate(monkey_numbers, op1) + calculate(monkey_numbers, op2)\n      [op1, \"-\", op2] -> calculate(monkey_numbers, op1) - calculate(monkey_numbers, op2)\n      [op1, \"*\", op2] -> calculate(monkey_numbers, op1) * calculate(monkey_numbers, op2)\n      [op1, \"/\", op2] -> calculate(monkey_numbers, op1) / calculate(monkey_numbers, op2)\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

The apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky. You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It's quite cold, but you don't see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you.\n\nThe Elf explains that you've arrived at Snow Island and apologizes for the lack of snow. He'll be happy to explain the situation, but it's a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don't get many visitors up here; would you like to play a game in the meantime?\n\nAs you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.\n\nTo get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.\n\nYou play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).\n\nFor example, the record of a few games might look like this:\n\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\nGame 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\nGame 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\nGame 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\nIn game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.\n\nThe Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?\n\nIn the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with that configuration.

The apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky. You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It's quite cold, but you don't see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you.\n\nThe Elf explains that you've arrived at Snow Island and apologizes for the lack of snow. He'll be happy to explain the situation, but it's a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don't get many visitors up here; would you like to play a game in the meantime?\n\nAs you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.\n\nTo get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.\n\nYou play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).\n\nFor example, the record of a few games might look like this:\n\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\nGame 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\nGame 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\nGame 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\nIn game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.\n\nThe Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?\n\nIn the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been impossible because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get 8.\n\nDetermine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. What is the sum of the IDs of those games?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 2207.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe Elf says they've stopped producing snow because they aren't getting any water! He isn't sure why the water stopped; however, he can show you how to get to the water source to check it out for yourself. It's just up ahead!\n\nAs you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible?\n\nAgain consider the example games from earlier:\n\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\nGame 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\nGame 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\nGame 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\nIn game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible.\nGame 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes.\nGame 3 must have been played with at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes.\nGame 4 required at least 14 red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes.\nGame 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3 green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag.\nThe power of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together. The power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1 is 48. In games 2-5 it was 12, 1560, 630, and 36, respectively. Adding up these five powers produces the sum 2286.\n\nFor each game, find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present. What is the sum of the power of these sets?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```elixir\ndefmodule CubeConundrum do\n  def call do\n    input = File.read!(\"input.txt\")\n    games = parse_input(input)\n    {part1(games), part2(games)}\n  end\n\n  defp parse_input(input) do\n    input\n    |> String.split(\"\\n\", trim: true)\n    |> Enum.map(&parse_game/1)\n  end\n\n  defp parse_game(line) do\n    [id_part | data] = String.split(line, \": \", parts: 2)\n    id = String.slice(id_part, 5..-1) |> String.to_integer()\n    sets = String.split(data |> List.first(), \"; \")\n    %{id: id, sets: Enum.map(sets, &parse_set/1)}\n  end\n\n  defp parse_set(set) do\n    Enum.reduce(String.split(set, \", \"), %{\"red\" => 0, \"green\" => 0, \"blue\" => 0}, fn entry, acc ->\n      [count, color] = String.split(entry, \" \")\n      Map.update!(acc, color, &(&1 + String.to_integer(count)))\n    end)\n  end\n\n  defp part1(games) do\n    Enum.filter(games, &possible?(&1.sets, %{\"red\" => 12, \"green\" => 13, \"blue\" => 14}))\n    |> Enum.map(& &1.id)\n    |> Enum.sum()\n  end\n\n  defp possible?(sets, bag) do\n    Enum.all?(sets, fn set ->\n      Enum.all?(Map.keys(set), fn color ->\n        set[color] <= bag[color]\n      end)\n    end)\n  end\n\n  defp part2(games) do\n    Enum.map(games, fn %{sets: sets} ->\n      sets\n      |> Enum.reduce(%{\"red\" => 0, \"green\" => 0, \"blue\" => 0}, fn set, acc ->\n        Enum.map(acc, fn {color, count} ->\n          {color, max(count, set[color])}\n        end) |> Enum.into(%{})\n      end)\n      |> Map.values()\n      |> Enum.reduce(1, &*/2)\n    end)\n    |> Enum.sum()\n  end\nend\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

After asking around, you discover that there is indeed normally a large pile of sand somewhere near here, but you don't see anything besides lots of water and the small island where the ferry has docked.\n\nAs you try to figure out what to do next, you notice a poster on a wall near the ferry dock. \"Boat races! Open to the public! Grand prize is an all-expenses-paid trip to Desert Island!\" That must be where the sand comes from! Best of all, the boat races are starting in just a few minutes.\n\nYou manage to sign up as a competitor in the boat races just in time. The organizer explains that it's not really a traditional race - instead, you will get a fixed amount of time during which your boat has to travel as far as it can, and you win if your boat goes the farthest.\n\nAs part of signing up, you get a sheet of paper (your puzzle input) that lists the time allowed for each race and also the best distance ever recorded in that race. To guarantee you win the grand prize, you need to make sure you go farther in each race than the current record holder.\n\nThe organizer brings you over to the area where the boat races are held. The boats are much smaller than you expected - they're actually toy boats, each with a big button on top. Holding down the button charges the boat, and releasing the button allows the boat to move. Boats move faster if their button was held longer, but time spent holding the button counts against the total race time. You can only hold the button at the start of the race, and boats don't move until the button is released.\n\nFor example:\n\nTime:      7  15   30\nDistance:  9  40  200\nThis document describes three races:\n\nThe first race lasts 7 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 9 millimeters.\nThe second race lasts 15 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 40 millimeters.\nThe third race lasts 30 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 200 millimeters.\nYour toy boat has a starting speed of zero millimeters per millisecond. For each whole millisecond you spend at the beginning of the race holding down the button, the boat's speed increases by one millimeter per millisecond.\n\nSo, because the first race lasts 7 milliseconds, you only have a few options:\n\nDon't hold the button at all (that is, hold it for 0 milliseconds) at the start of the race. The boat won't move; it will have traveled 0 millimeters by the end of the race.\nHold the button for 1 millisecond at the start of the race. Then, the boat will travel at a speed of 1 millimeter per millisecond for 6 milliseconds, reaching a total distance traveled of 6 millimeters.\nHold the button for 2 milliseconds, giving the boat a speed of 2 millimeters per millisecond. It will then get 5 milliseconds to move, reaching a total distance of 10 millimeters.\nHold the button for 3 milliseconds. After its remaining 4 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone 12 millimeters.\nHold the button for 4 milliseconds. After its remaining 3 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone 12 millimeters.\nHold the button for 5 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 10 millimeters.\nHold the button for 6 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 6 millimeters.\nHold the button for 7 milliseconds. That's the entire duration of the race. You never let go of the button. The boat can't move until you let go of the button. Please make sure you let go of the button so the boat gets to move. 0 millimeters.\nSince the current record for this race is 9 millimeters, there are actually 4 different ways you could win: you could hold the button for 2, 3, 4, or 5 milliseconds at the start of the race.\n\nIn the second race, you could hold the button for at least 4 milliseconds and at most 11 milliseconds and beat the record, a total of 8 different ways to win.\n\nIn the third race, you could hold the button for at least 11 milliseconds and no more than 19 milliseconds and still beat the record, a total of 9 ways you could win.\n\nTo see how much margin of error you have, determine the number of ways you can beat the record in each race; in this example, if you multiply these values together, you get 288 (4 * 8 * 9).\n\nDetermine the number of ways you could beat the record in each race.
