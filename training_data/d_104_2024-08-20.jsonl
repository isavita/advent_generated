The sandstorm subsequently subsides, somehow seeing you standing at an oasis!\n\nThe camel goes to get some water and you stretch your neck. As you look up, you discover what must be yet another giant floating island, this one made of metal! That must be where the parts to fix the sand machines come from.\n\nThere's even a hang glider partially buried in the sand here; once the sun rises and heats up the sand, you might be able to use the glider and the hot air to get all the way up to the metal island!\n\nWhile you wait for the sun to rise, you admire the oasis hidden here in the middle of Desert Island. It must have a delicate ecosystem; you might as well take some ecological readings while you wait. Maybe you can report any environmental instabilities you find to someone so the oasis can be around for the next sandstorm-worn traveler.\n\nYou pull out your handy Oasis And Sand Instability Sensor and analyze your surroundings. The OASIS produces a report of many values and how they are changing over time (your puzzle input). Each line in the report contains the history of a single value. For example:\n\n0 3 6 9 12 15\n1 3 6 10 15 21\n10 13 16 21 30 45\nTo best protect the oasis, your environmental report should include a prediction of the next value in each history. To do this, start by making a new sequence from the difference at each step of your history. If that sequence is not all zeroes, repeat this process, using the sequence you just generated as the input sequence. Once all of the values in your latest sequence are zeroes, you can extrapolate what the next value of the original history should be.\n\nIn the above dataset, the first history is 0 3 6 9 12 15. Because the values increase by 3 each step, the first sequence of differences that you generate will be 3 3 3 3 3. Note that this sequence has one fewer value than the input sequence because at each step it considers two numbers from the input. Since these values aren't all zero, repeat the process: the values differ by 0 at each step, so the next sequence is 0 0 0 0. This means you have enough information to extrapolate the history! Visually, these sequences can be arranged like this:\n\n0   3   6   9  12  15\n  3   3   3   3   3\n    0   0   0   0\nTo extrapolate, start by adding a new zero to the end of your list of zeroes; because the zeroes represent differences between the two values above them, this also means there is now a placeholder in every sequence above it:\n\n0   3   6   9  12  15   B\n  3   3   3   3   3   A\n    0   0   0   0   0\nYou can then start filling in placeholders from the bottom up. A needs to be the result of increasing 3 (the value to its left) by 0 (the value below it); this means A must be 3:\n\n0   3   6   9  12  15   B\n  3   3   3   3   3   3\n    0   0   0   0   0\nFinally, you can fill in B, which needs to be the result of increasing 15 (the value to its left) by 3 (the value below it), or 18:\n\n0   3   6   9  12  15  18\n  3   3   3   3   3   3\n    0   0   0   0   0\nSo, the next value of the first history is 18.\n\nFinding all-zero differences for the second history requires an additional sequence:\n\n1   3   6  10  15  21\n  2   3   4   5   6\n    1   1   1   1\n      0   0   0\nThen, following the same process as before, work out the next value in each sequence from the bottom up:\n\n1   3   6  10  15  21  28\n  2   3   4   5   6   7\n    1   1   1   1   1\n      0   0   0   0\nSo, the next value of the second history is 28.\n\nThe third history requires even more sequences, but its next value can be found the same way:\n\n10  13  16  21  30  45  68\n   3   3   5   9  15  23\n     0   2   4   6   8\n       2   2   2   2\n         0   0   0\nSo, the next value of the third history is 68.\n\nIf you find the next value for each history in this example and add them together, you get 114.\n\nAnalyze your OASIS report and extrapolate the next value for each history.

Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.\n\nHowever, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they've noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).\n\nFor example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:\n\n2-4,6-8\n2-3,4-5\n5-7,7-9\n2-8,3-7\n6-6,4-6\n2-6,4-8\nFor the first few pairs, this list means:\n\nWithin the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8).\nThe Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.\nThe Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9.\nThis example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:\n\n.234.....  2-4\n.....678.  6-8\n\n.23......  2-3\n...45....  4-5\n\n....567..  5-7\n......789  7-9\n\n.2345678.  2-8\n..34567..  3-7\n\n.....6...  6-6\n...456...  4-6\n\n.23456...  2-6\n...45678.  4-8\nSome of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other. For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained by 4-6. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration. In this example, there are 2 such pairs.\n\nIn how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 526.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nIt seems like there is still quite a bit of duplicate work planned. Instead, the Elves would like to know the number of pairs that overlap at all.\n\nIn the above example, the first two pairs (2-4,6-8 and 2-3,4-5) don't overlap, while the remaining four pairs (5-7,7-9, 2-8,3-7, 6-6,4-6, and 2-6,4-8) do overlap:\n\n5-7,7-9 overlaps in a single section, 7.\n2-8,3-7 overlaps all of the sections 3 through 7.\n6-6,4-6 overlaps in a single section, 6.\n2-6,4-8 overlaps in sections 4, 5, and 6.\nSo, in this example, the number of overlapping assignment pairs is 4.\n\nIn how many assignment pairs do the ranges overlap?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.conv;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    auto file = File(\"input.txt\", \"r\");\n\n    int count = 0;\n    foreach (line; file.byLine())\n    {\n        auto pair = line.split(\",\");\n        \n        auto left = parseRange(pair[0].idup); // idup to create a copy of the string\n        auto right = parseRange(pair[1].idup);\n\n        if (left[0] <= right[1] && left[1] >= right[0])\n        {\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    writeln(count);\n}\n\nint[] parseRange(string s)\n{\n    auto split = s.split(\"-\");\n    int start = to!int(split[0]);\n    int end = to!int(split[1]);\n    return [start, end];\n}\n```\n"}]}

To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.\n\nRock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.\n\nAppreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. \"The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors.

Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.\n\nThe winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).\n\nSince you can't be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.\n\nFor example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:\n\nA Y\nB X\nC Z\nThis strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:\n\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).\nIn the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).\nThe third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.\nIn this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).\n\nWhat would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 14827.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe Elf finishes helping with the tent and sneaks back over to you. \"Anyway, the second column says how the round needs to end: X means you need to lose, Y means you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means you need to win. Good luck!\"\n\nThe total score is still calculated in the same way, but now you need to figure out what shape to choose so the round ends as indicated. The example above now goes like this:\n\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you need the round to end in a draw (Y), so you also choose Rock. This gives you a score of 1 + 3 = 4.\nIn the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you choose Rock so you lose (X) with a score of 1 + 0 = 1.\nIn the third round, you will defeat your opponent's Scissors with Rock for a score of 1 + 6 = 7.\nNow that you're correctly decrypting the ultra top secret strategy guide, you would get a total score of 12.\n\nFollowing the Elf's instructions for the second column, what would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.file;\nimport std.conv;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n\tauto file = File(\"input.txt\", \"r\");\n\tif (!file.isOpen)\n\t{\n\t\twriteln(\"Error opening file\");\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tint totalScore = 0;\n\n\tforeach (line; file.byLine())\n\t{\n\t\tauto opponent = line[0];\n\t\tauto roundEnd = line[2];\n\n\t\tchar yourMove = ' ';\n\t\tif (roundEnd == 'X')\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif (opponent == 'A')\n\t\t\t\tyourMove = 'Z';\n\t\t\telse if (opponent == 'B')\n\t\t\t\tyourMove = 'X';\n\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\tyourMove = 'Y';\n\t\t}\n\t\telse if (roundEnd == 'Y')\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif (opponent == 'A')\n\t\t\t\tyourMove = 'X';\n\t\t\telse if (opponent == 'B')\n\t\t\t\tyourMove = 'Y';\n\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\tyourMove = 'Z';\n\t\t}\n\t\telse\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif (opponent == 'A')\n\t\t\t\tyourMove = 'Y';\n\t\t\telse if (opponent == 'B')\n\t\t\t\tyourMove = 'Z';\n\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\tyourMove = 'X';\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tint score = 0;\n\t\tif (yourMove == 'X')\n\t\t\tscore = 1;\n\t\telse if (yourMove == 'Y')\n\t\t\tscore = 2;\n\t\telse if (yourMove == 'Z')\n\t\t\tscore = 3;\n\n\t\tif ((opponent == 'A' && yourMove == 'Y') || (opponent == 'B' && yourMove == 'Z') || (opponent == 'C' && yourMove == 'X'))\n\t\t\tscore += 6;\n\t\telse if ((opponent == 'A' && yourMove == 'X') || (opponent == 'B' && yourMove == 'Y') || (opponent == 'C' && yourMove == 'Z'))\n\t\t\tscore += 3;\n\n\t\ttotalScore += score;\n\t}\n\n\twriteln(totalScore);\n}\n```\n"}]}

Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.\n\nFor example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:\n\n1000\n2000\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n6000\n\n7000\n8000\n9000\n\n10000\nThis list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:\n\nThe first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.\nThe second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.\nThe third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.\nThe fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.\nThe fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.\nIn case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories.

That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.\n\nIn the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with 24000 Calories), then the third Elf (with 11000 Calories), then the fifth Elf (with 10000 Calories).

HI, the message says. You continue searching for the sleigh keys.\n\nAhead of you is what appears to be a large ocean trench. Could the keys have fallen into it? You'd better send a probe to investigate.\n\nThe probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any integer velocity in the x (forward) and y (upward, or downward if negative) directions. For example, an initial x,y velocity like 0,10 would fire the probe straight up, while an initial velocity like 10,-1 would fire the probe forward at a slight downward angle.\n\nThe probe's x,y position starts at 0,0. Then, it will follow some trajectory by moving in steps. On each step, these changes occur in the following order:\n\nThe probe's x position increases by its x velocity.\nThe probe's y position increases by its y velocity.\nDue to drag, the probe's x velocity changes by 1 toward the value 0; that is, it decreases by 1 if it is greater than 0, increases by 1 if it is less than 0, or does not change if it is already 0.\nDue to gravity, the probe's y velocity decreases by 1.\nFor the probe to successfully make it into the trench, the probe must be on some trajectory that causes it to be within a target area after any step. The submarine computer has already calculated this target area (your puzzle input). For example:\n\ntarget area: x=20..30, y=-10..-5\nThis target area means that you need to find initial x,y velocity values such that after any step, the probe's x position is at least 20 and at most 30, and the probe's y position is at least -10 and at most -5.\n\nGiven this target area, one initial velocity that causes the probe to be within the target area after any step is 7,2:\n\n.............#....#............\n.......#..............#........\n...............................\nS........................#.....\n...............................\n...............................\n...........................#...\n...............................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTT#TT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\nIn this diagram, S is the probe's initial position, 0,0. The x coordinate increases to the right, and the y coordinate increases upward. In the bottom right, positions that are within the target area are shown as T. After each step (until the target area is reached), the position of the probe is marked with #. (The bottom-right # is both a position the probe reaches and a position in the target area.)\n\nAnother initial velocity that causes the probe to be within the target area after any step is 6,3:\n\n...............#..#............\n...........#........#..........\n...............................\n......#..............#.........\n...............................\n...............................\nS....................#.........\n...............................\n...............................\n...............................\n.....................#.........\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................T#TTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\nAnother one is 9,0:\n\nS........#.....................\n.................#.............\n...............................\n........................#......\n...............................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTT#\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT\nOne initial velocity that doesn't cause the probe to be within the target area after any step is 17,-4:\n\nS..............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n.................#.............................................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT..#.............................\n....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n................................................#..............\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n...............................................................\n..............................................................#\nThe probe appears to pass through the target area, but is never within it after any step. Instead, it continues down and to the right - only the first few steps are shown.\n\nIf you're going to fire a highly scientific probe out of a super cool probe launcher, you might as well do it with style. How high can you make the probe go while still reaching the target area?\n\nIn the above example, using an initial velocity of 6,9 is the best you can do, causing the probe to reach a maximum y position of 45. (Any higher initial y velocity causes the probe to overshoot the target area entirely.)\n\nFind the initial velocity that causes the probe to reach the highest y position and still eventually be within the target area after any step.

Crab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible.\n\nFor example, consider the following horizontal positions:\n\n16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14\nThis means there's a crab with horizontal position 16, a crab with horizontal position 1, and so on.\n\nEach change of 1 step in horizontal position of a single crab costs 1 fuel.

How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 351901.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe crabs don't seem interested in your proposed solution. Perhaps you misunderstand crab engineering?\n\nAs it turns out, crab submarine engines don't burn fuel at a constant rate. Instead, each change of 1 step in horizontal position costs 1 more unit of fuel than the last: the first step costs 1, the second step costs 2, the third step costs 3, and so on.\n\nAs each crab moves, moving further becomes more expensive.

You should probably figure out where it's going. For example:\n\nforward 5\ndown 5\nforward 8\nup 3\ndown 8\nforward 2\nYour horizontal position and depth both start at 0. The steps above would then modify them as follows:\n\nforward 5 adds 5 to your horizontal position, a total of 5.\ndown 5 adds 5 to your depth, resulting in a value of 5.\nforward 8 adds 8 to your horizontal position, a total of 13.\nup 3 decreases your depth by 3, resulting in a value of 2.\ndown 8 adds 8 to your depth, resulting in a value of 10.\nforward 2 adds 2 to your horizontal position, a total of 15.\nAfter following these instructions, you would have a horizontal position of 15 and a depth of 10. (Multiplying these together produces 150.)\n\nCalculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 1451208.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nBased on your calculations, the planned course doesn't seem to make any sense. You find the submarine manual and discover that the process is actually slightly more complicated.\n\nIn addition to horizontal position and depth, you'll also need to track a third value, aim, which also starts at 0. The commands also mean something entirely different than you first thought:\n\ndown X increases your aim by X units.\nup X decreases your aim by X units.\nforward X does two things:\nIt increases your horizontal position by X units.\nIt increases your depth by your aim multiplied by X.\nAgain note that since you're on a submarine, down and up do the opposite of what you might expect: \"down\" means aiming in the positive direction.\n\nNow, the above example does something different:\n\nforward 5 adds 5 to your horizontal position, a total of 5. Because your aim is 0, your depth does not change.\ndown 5 adds 5 to your aim, resulting in a value of 5.\nforward 8 adds 8 to your horizontal position, a total of 13. Because your aim is 5, your depth increases by 8*5=40.\nup 3 decreases your aim by 3, resulting in a value of 2.\ndown 8 adds 8 to your aim, resulting in a value of 10.\nforward 2 adds 2 to your horizontal position, a total of 15. Because your aim is 10, your depth increases by 2*10=20 to a total of 60.\nAfter following these new instructions, you would have a horizontal position of 15 and a depth of 60. (Multiplying these produces 900.)\n\nUsing this new interpretation of the commands, calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.file;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.string;\nimport std.stdio; // Added import statement for writeln\n\nvoid main() {\n    string input = cast(string) read(\"input.txt\");\n    int horizontal = 0;\n    int depth = 0;\n    int aim = 0;\n\n    foreach (line; input.splitLines()) {\n        auto parts = line.split(\" \");\n        int value = to!int(parts[1]);\n\n        if (parts[0] == \"forward\") {\n            horizontal += value;\n            depth += aim * value;\n        } else if (parts[0] == \"down\") {\n            aim += value;\n        } else if (parts[0] == \"up\") {\n            aim -= value;\n        }\n    }\n\n    writeln(horizontal * depth);\n}\n```\n"}]}

Good luck!\n\nAs the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar sweep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.\n\nFor example, suppose you had the following report:\n\n199\n200\n208\n210\n200\n207\n240\n269\n260\n263\nThis report indicates that, scanning outward from the submarine, the sonar sweep found depths of 199, 200, 208, 210, and so on.\n\nThe first order of business is to figure out how quickly the depth increases, just so you know what you're dealing with - you never know if the keys will get carried into deeper water by an ocean current or a fish or something.\n\nTo do this, count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement. (There is no measurement before the first measurement.) In the example above, the changes are as follows:\n\n199 (N/A - no previous measurement)\n200 (increased)\n208 (increased)\n210 (increased)\n200 (decreased)\n207 (increased)\n240 (increased)\n269 (increased)\n260 (decreased)\n263 (increased)\nIn this example, there are 7 measurements that are larger than the previous measurement.\n\nHow many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 1766.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nConsidering every single measurement isn't as useful as you expected: there's just too much noise in the data.\n\nInstead, consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window. Again considering the above example:\n\n199  A      \n200  A B    \n208  A B C  \n210    B C D\n200  E   C D\n207  E F   D\n240  E F G  \n269    F G H\n260      G H\n263        H\nStart by comparing the first and second three-measurement windows. The measurements in the first window are marked A (199, 200, 208); their sum is 199 + 200 + 208 = 607. The second window is marked B (200, 208, 210); its sum is 618. The sum of measurements in the second window is larger than the sum of the first, so this first comparison increased.\n\nYour goal now is to count the number of times the sum of measurements in this sliding window increases from the previous sum. So, compare A with B, then compare B with C, then C with D, and so on. Stop when there aren't enough measurements left to create a new three-measurement sum.\n\nIn the above example, the sum of each three-measurement window is as follows:\n\nA: 607 (N/A - no previous sum)\nB: 618 (increased)\nC: 618 (no change)\nD: 617 (decreased)\nE: 647 (increased)\nF: 716 (increased)\nG: 769 (increased)\nH: 792 (increased)\nIn this example, there are 5 sums that are larger than the previous sum.\n\nConsider sums of a three-measurement sliding window.

Fortunately, you brought a small deck of space cards! You'd like to play a game of Combat, and there's even an opponent available: a small crab that climbed aboard your raft before you left.\n\nFortunately, it doesn't take long to teach the crab the rules.\n\nBefore the game starts, split the cards so each player has their own deck (your puzzle input). Then, the game consists of a series of rounds: both players draw their top card, and the player with the higher-valued card wins the round. The winner keeps both cards, placing them on the bottom of their own deck so that the winner's card is above the other card. If this causes a player to have all of the cards, they win, and the game ends.\n\nFor example, consider the following starting decks:\n\nPlayer 1:\n9\n2\n6\n3\n1\n\nPlayer 2:\n5\n8\n4\n7\n10\nThis arrangement means that player 1's deck contains 5 cards, with 9 on top and 1 on the bottom; player 2's deck also contains 5 cards, with 5 on top and 10 on the bottom.\n\nThe first round begins with both players drawing the top card of their decks: 9 and 5. Player 1 has the higher card, so both cards move to the bottom of player 1's deck such that 9 is above 5. In total, it takes 29 rounds before a player has all of the cards:\n\n-- Round 1 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 9, 2, 6, 3, 1\nPlayer 2's deck: 5, 8, 4, 7, 10\nPlayer 1 plays: 9\nPlayer 2 plays: 5\nPlayer 1 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 2 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 2, 6, 3, 1, 9, 5\nPlayer 2's deck: 8, 4, 7, 10\nPlayer 1 plays: 2\nPlayer 2 plays: 8\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 3 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 6, 3, 1, 9, 5\nPlayer 2's deck: 4, 7, 10, 8, 2\nPlayer 1 plays: 6\nPlayer 2 plays: 4\nPlayer 1 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 4 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 3, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4\nPlayer 2's deck: 7, 10, 8, 2\nPlayer 1 plays: 3\nPlayer 2 plays: 7\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 5 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 1, 9, 5, 6, 4\nPlayer 2's deck: 10, 8, 2, 7, 3\nPlayer 1 plays: 1\nPlayer 2 plays: 10\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n...several more rounds pass...\n\n-- Round 27 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 5, 4, 1\nPlayer 2's deck: 8, 9, 7, 3, 2, 10, 6\nPlayer 1 plays: 5\nPlayer 2 plays: 8\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 28 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 4, 1\nPlayer 2's deck: 9, 7, 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5\nPlayer 1 plays: 4\nPlayer 2 plays: 9\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n-- Round 29 --\nPlayer 1's deck: 1\nPlayer 2's deck: 7, 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5, 9, 4\nPlayer 1 plays: 1\nPlayer 2 plays: 7\nPlayer 2 wins the round!\n\n\n== Post-game results ==\nPlayer 1's deck: \nPlayer 2's deck: 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5, 9, 4, 7, 1\nOnce the game ends, you can calculate the winning player's score. The bottom card in their deck is worth the value of the card multiplied by 1, the second-from-the-bottom card is worth the value of the card multiplied by 2, and so on. With 10 cards, the top card is worth the value on the card multiplied by 10. In this example, the winning player's score is:\n\n   3 * 10\n+  2 *  9\n+ 10 *  8\n+  6 *  7\n+  8 *  6\n+  5 *  5\n+  9 *  4\n+  4 *  3\n+  7 *  2\n+  1 *  1\n= 306\nSo, once the game ends, the winning player's score is 306.\n\nPlay the small crab in a game of Combat using the two decks you just dealt.

You take it.\n\nWhile you wait for your flight, you decide to check in with the Elves back at the North Pole. They're playing a memory game and are ever so excited to explain the rules!\n\nIn this game, the players take turns saying numbers. They begin by taking turns reading from a list of starting numbers (your puzzle input). Then, each turn consists of considering the most recently spoken number:\n\nIf that was the first time the number has been spoken, the current player says 0.\nOtherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces how many turns apart the number is from when it was previously spoken.\nSo, after the starting numbers, each turn results in that player speaking aloud either 0 (if the last number is new) or an age (if the last number is a repeat).\n\nFor example, suppose the starting numbers are 0,3,6:\n\nTurn 1: The 1st number spoken is a starting number, 0.\nTurn 2: The 2nd number spoken is a starting number, 3.\nTurn 3: The 3rd number spoken is a starting number, 6.\nTurn 4: Now, consider the last number spoken, 6. Since that was the first time the number had been spoken, the 4th number spoken is 0.\nTurn 5: Next, again consider the last number spoken, 0. Since it had been spoken before, the next number to speak is the difference between the turn number when it was last spoken (the previous turn, 4) and the turn number of the time it was most recently spoken before then (turn 1). Thus, the 5th number spoken is 4 - 1, 3.\nTurn 6: The last number spoken, 3 had also been spoken before, most recently on turns 5 and 2. So, the 6th number spoken is 5 - 2, 3.\nTurn 7: Since 3 was just spoken twice in a row, and the last two turns are 1 turn apart, the 7th number spoken is 1.\nTurn 8: Since 1 is new, the 8th number spoken is 0.\nTurn 9: 0 was last spoken on turns 8 and 4, so the 9th number spoken is the difference between them, 4.\nTurn 10: 4 is new, so the 10th number spoken is 0.\n(The game ends when the Elves get sick of playing or dinner is ready, whichever comes first.)\n\nTheir question for you is: what will be the 2020th number spoken?

Only the L and R actions change the direction the ship is facing.

Before you can figure out whether it will impact your vacation plans, however, your device suddenly turns off!\n\nIts battery is dead.\n\nYou'll need to plug it in. There's only one problem: the charging outlet near your seat produces the wrong number of jolts. Always prepared, you make a list of all of the joltage adapters in your bag.\n\nEach of your joltage adapters is rated for a specific output joltage (your puzzle input). Any given adapter can take an input 1, 2, or 3 jolts lower than its rating and still produce its rated output joltage.\n\nIn addition, your device has a built-in joltage adapter rated for 3 jolts higher than the highest-rated adapter in your bag. (If your adapter list were 3, 9, and 6, your device's built-in adapter would be rated for 12 jolts.)\n\nTreat the charging outlet near your seat as having an effective joltage rating of 0.\n\nSince you have some time to kill, you might as well test all of your adapters. Wouldn't want to get to your resort and realize you can't even charge your device!\n\nIf you use every adapter in your bag at once, what is the distribution of joltage differences between the charging outlet, the adapters, and your device?\n\nFor example, suppose that in your bag, you have adapters with the following joltage ratings:\n\n16\n10\n15\n5\n1\n11\n7\n19\n6\n12\n4\nWith these adapters, your device's built-in joltage adapter would be rated for 19 + 3 = 22 jolts, 3 higher than the highest-rated adapter.\n\nBecause adapters can only connect to a source 1-3 jolts lower than its rating, in order to use every adapter, you'd need to choose them like this:\n\nThe charging outlet has an effective rating of 0 jolts, so the only adapters that could connect to it directly would need to have a joltage rating of 1, 2, or 3 jolts. Of these, only one you have is an adapter rated 1 jolt (difference of 1).\nFrom your 1-jolt rated adapter, the only choice is your 4-jolt rated adapter (difference of 3).\nFrom the 4-jolt rated adapter, the adapters rated 5, 6, or 7 are valid choices. However, in order to not skip any adapters, you have to pick the adapter rated 5 jolts (difference of 1).\nSimilarly, the next choices would need to be the adapter rated 6 and then the adapter rated 7 (with difference of 1 and 1).\nThe only adapter that works with the 7-jolt rated adapter is the one rated 10 jolts (difference of 3).\nFrom 10, the choices are 11 or 12; choose 11 (difference of 1) and then 12 (difference of 1).\nAfter 12, only valid adapter has a rating of 15 (difference of 3), then 16 (difference of 1), then 19 (difference of 3).\nFinally, your device's built-in adapter is always 3 higher than the highest adapter, so its rating is 22 jolts (always a difference of 3).\nIn this example, when using every adapter, there are 7 differences of 1 jolt and 5 differences of 3 jolts.\n\nHere is a larger example:\n\n28\n33\n18\n42\n31\n14\n46\n20\n48\n47\n24\n23\n49\n45\n19\n38\n39\n11\n1\n32\n25\n35\n8\n17\n7\n9\n4\n2\n34\n10\n3\nIn this larger example, in a chain that uses all of the adapters, there are 22 differences of 1 jolt and 10 differences of 3 jolts.\n\nFind a chain that uses all of your adapters to connect the charging outlet to your device's built-in adapter and count the joltage differences between the charging outlet, the adapters, and your device. What is the number of 1-jolt differences multiplied by the number of 3-jolt differences?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 2812.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nTo completely determine whether you have enough adapters, you'll need to figure out how many different ways they can be arranged. Every arrangement needs to connect the charging outlet to your device. The previous rules about when adapters can successfully connect still apply.\n\nThe first example above (the one that starts with 16, 10, 15) supports the following arrangements:\n\n(0), 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)\n(0), 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)\n(0), 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)\n(0), 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)\n(0), 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)\n(0), 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)\n(0), 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)\n(0), 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)\n(The charging outlet and your device's built-in adapter are shown in parentheses.)

After that, each number you receive should be the sum of any two of the 25 immediately previous numbers. The two numbers will have different values, and there might be more than one such pair.\n\nFor example, suppose your preamble consists of the numbers 1 through 25 in a random order. To be valid, the next number must be the sum of two of those numbers:\n\n26 would be a valid next number, as it could be 1 plus 25 (or many other pairs, like 2 and 24).\n49 would be a valid next number, as it is the sum of 24 and 25.\n100 would not be valid; no two of the previous 25 numbers sum to 100.\n50 would also not be valid; although 25 appears in the previous 25 numbers, the two numbers in the pair must be different.\nSuppose the 26th number is 45, and the first number (no longer an option, as it is more than 25 numbers ago) was 20. Now, for the next number to be valid, there needs to be some pair of numbers among 1-19, 21-25, or 45 that add up to it:\n\n26 would still be a valid next number, as 1 and 25 are still within the previous 25 numbers.\n65 would not be valid, as no two of the available numbers sum to it.\n64 and 66 would both be valid, as they are the result of 19+45 and 21+45 respectively.\nHere is a larger example which only considers the previous 5 numbers (and has a preamble of length 5):\n\n35\n20\n15\n25\n47\n40\n62\n55\n65\n95\n102\n117\n150\n182\n127\n219\n299\n277\n309\n576\nIn this example, after the 5-number preamble, almost every number is the sum of two of the previous 5 numbers; the only number that does not follow this rule is 127.\n\nThe first step of attacking the weakness in the XMAS data is to find the first number in the list (after the preamble) which is not the sum of two of the 25 numbers before it.

The instruction immediately below it is executed next.\nFor example, consider the following program:\n\nnop +0\nacc +1\njmp +4\nacc +3\njmp -3\nacc -99\nacc +1\njmp -4\nacc +6\nThese instructions are visited in this order:\n\nnop +0  | 1\nacc +1  | 2, 8(!)\njmp +4  | 3\nacc +3  | 6\njmp -3  | 7\nacc -99 |\nacc +1  | 4\njmp -4  | 5\nacc +6  |\nFirst, the nop +0 does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (acc +1) and jmp +4 sets the next instruction to the other acc +1 near the bottom. After it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, jmp -4 executes, setting the next instruction to the only acc +3. It sets the accumulator to 5, and jmp -3 causes the program to continue back at the first acc +1.\n\nThis is an infinite loop: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment the program tries to run any instruction a second time, you know it will never terminate.\n\nImmediately before the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the accumulator is 5.\n\nRun your copy of the boot code. Immediately before any instruction is executed a second time, what value is in the accumulator?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.conv;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    string[] instructions;\n    foreach (line; File(\"input.txt\").byLine)\n    {\n        instructions ~= line.idup; // Use idup to create a copy of the line as a string\n    }\n\n    int accumulator = 0;\n    int currentInstruction = 0;\n    bool loopDetected = false;\n    int[] visited = new int[](instructions.length);\n\n    while (currentInstruction < instructions.length)\n    {\n        if (visited[currentInstruction] == 1)\n        {\n            loopDetected = true;\n            break;\n        }\n\n        visited[currentInstruction] = 1;\n        auto parts = instructions[currentInstruction].split(\" \");\n        auto op = parts[0];\n        int arg = to!int(parts[1]);\n\n        if (op == \"acc\")\n        {\n            accumulator += arg;\n            currentInstruction++;\n        }\n        else if (op == \"jmp\")\n        {\n            currentInstruction += arg;\n        }\n        else if (op == \"nop\")\n        {\n            currentInstruction++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    writeln(accumulator);\n}\n```\n"}]}

You aren't sure which seat is yours, and all of the flight attendants are busy with the flood of people that suddenly made it through passport control.\n\nYou write a quick program to use your phone's camera to scan all of the nearby boarding passes (your puzzle input); perhaps you can find your seat through process of elimination.\n\nInstead of zones or groups, this airline uses binary space partitioning to seat people. A seat might be specified like FBFBBFFRLR, where F means \"front\", B means \"back\", L means \"left\", and R means \"right\".\n\nThe first 7 characters will either be F or B; these specify exactly one of the 128 rows on the plane (numbered 0 through 127). Each letter tells you which half of a region the given seat is in. Start with the whole list of rows; the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the front (0 through 63) or the back (64 through 127). The next letter indicates which half of that region the seat is in, and so on until you're left with exactly one row.\n\nFor example, consider just the first seven characters of FBFBBFFRLR:\n\nStart by considering the whole range, rows 0 through 127.\nF means to take the lower half, keeping rows 0 through 63.\nB means to take the upper half, keeping rows 32 through 63.\nF means to take the lower half, keeping rows 32 through 47.\nB means to take the upper half, keeping rows 40 through 47.\nB keeps rows 44 through 47.\nF keeps rows 44 through 45.\nThe final F keeps the lower of the two, row 44.\nThe last three characters will be either L or R; these specify exactly one of the 8 columns of seats on the plane (numbered 0 through 7). The same process as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps. L means to keep the lower half, while R means to keep the upper half.\n\nFor example, consider just the last 3 characters of FBFBBFFRLR:\n\nStart by considering the whole range, columns 0 through 7.\nR means to take the upper half, keeping columns 4 through 7.\nL means to take the lower half, keeping columns 4 through 5.\nThe final R keeps the upper of the two, column 5.\nSo, decoding FBFBBFFRLR reveals that it is the seat at row 44, column 5.\n\nEvery seat also has a unique seat ID: multiply the row by 8, then add the column. In this example, the seat has ID 44 * 8 + 5 = 357.\n\nHere are some other boarding passes:\n\nBFFFBBFRRR: row 70, column 7, seat ID 567.\nFFFBBBFRRR: row 14, column 7, seat ID 119.\nBBFFBBFRLL: row 102, column 4, seat ID 820.\nAs a sanity check, look through your list of boarding passes.

While these documents are extremely similar, North Pole Credentials aren't issued by a country and therefore aren't actually valid documentation for travel in most of the world.\n\nIt seems like you're not the only one having problems, though; a very long line has formed for the automatic passport scanners, and the delay could upset your travel itinerary.\n\nDue to some questionable network security, you realize you might be able to solve both of these problems at the same time.\n\nThe automatic passport scanners are slow because they're having trouble detecting which passports have all required fields. The expected fields are as follows:\n\nbyr (Birth Year)\niyr (Issue Year)\neyr (Expiration Year)\nhgt (Height)\nhcl (Hair Color)\necl (Eye Color)\npid (Passport ID)\ncid (Country ID)\nPassport data is validated in batch files (your puzzle input). Each passport is represented as a sequence of key:value pairs separated by spaces or newlines.

The second passport is invalid - it is missing hgt (the Height field).\n\nThe third passport is interesting; the only missing field is cid, so it looks like data from North Pole Credentials, not a passport at all! Surely, nobody would mind if you made the system temporarily ignore missing cid fields. Treat this \"passport\" as valid.\n\nThe fourth passport is missing two fields, cid and byr. Missing cid is fine, but missing any other field is not, so this passport is invalid.\n\nAccording to the above rules, your improved system would report 2 valid passports.\n\nCount the number of valid passports - those that have all required fields.

While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.\n\nDue to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (.) and trees (#) you can see.

For example, to cut 3:\n\nTop          Bottom\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n\n      3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 1 2                 Cut cards\n\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9         Your deck\n              0 1 2   Cut cards\n\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2   Your deck\nYou've also been getting pretty good at a version of this technique where N is negative! In that case, cut (the absolute value of) N cards from the bottom of the deck onto the top. For example, to cut -4:\n\nTop          Bottom\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5           Your deck\n            6 7 8 9   Cut cards\n\n        0 1 2 3 4 5   Your deck\n6 7 8 9               Cut cards\n\n6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5   Your deck\nTo deal with increment N, start by clearing enough space on your table to lay out all of the cards individually in a long line. Deal the top card into the leftmost position. Then, move N positions to the right and deal the next card there. If you would move into a position past the end of the space on your table, wrap around and keep counting from the leftmost card again. Continue this process until you run out of cards.\n\nFor example, to deal with increment 3:\n\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n. . . . . . . . . .   Space on table\n^                     Current position\n\nDeal the top card to the current position:\n\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . . . . . . . . .   Space on table\n^                     Current position\n\nMove the current position right 3:\n\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . . . . . . . . .   Space on table\n      ^               Current position\n\nDeal the top card:\n\n    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . . 1 . . . . . .   Space on table\n      ^               Current position\n\nMove right 3 and deal:\n\n      3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . . 1 . . 2 . . .   Space on table\n            ^         Current position\n\nMove right 3 and deal:\n\n        4 5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . . 1 . . 2 . . 3   Space on table\n                  ^   Current position\n\nMove right 3, wrapping around, and deal:\n\n          5 6 7 8 9   Your deck\n0 . 4 1 . . 2 . . 3   Space on table\n    ^                 Current position\n\nAnd so on:\n\n0 7 4 1 8 5 2 9 6 3   Space on table\nPositions on the table which already contain cards are still counted; they're not skipped. Of course, this technique is carefully designed so it will never put two cards in the same position or leave a position empty.\n\nFinally, collect the cards on the table so that the leftmost card ends up at the top of your deck, the card to its right ends up just below the top card, and so on, until the rightmost card ends up at the bottom of the deck.\n\nThe complete shuffle process (your puzzle input) consists of applying many of these techniques. Here are some examples that combine techniques; they all start with a factory order deck of 10 cards:\n\ndeal with increment 7\ndeal into new stack\ndeal into new stack\nResult: 0 3 6 9 2 5 8 1 4 7\ncut 6\ndeal with increment 7\ndeal into new stack\nResult: 3 0 7 4 1 8 5 2 9 6\ndeal with increment 7\ndeal with increment 9\ncut -2\nResult: 6 3 0 7 4 1 8 5 2 9\ndeal into new stack\ncut -2\ndeal with increment 7\ncut 8\ncut -4\ndeal with increment 7\ncut 3\ndeal with increment 9\ndeal with increment 3\ncut -1\nResult: 9 2 5 8 1 4 7 0 3 6\nPositions within the deck count from 0 at the top, then 1 for the card immediately below the top card, and so on to the bottom. (That is, cards start in the position matching their number.)\n\nAfter shuffling your factory order deck of 10007 cards, what is the position of card 2019?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.algorithm;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.file;\nimport std.range;\nimport std.string;\nimport std.stdio; // Added import for writeln\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    auto instructions = readText(\"input.txt\").strip().splitter(\"\\n\").array;\n\n    int deckSize = 10007;\n    int cardPosition = 2019;\n\n    foreach (instruction; instructions)\n    {\n        if (instruction.startsWith(\"deal into new stack\"))\n        {\n            cardPosition = deckSize - 1 - cardPosition;\n        }\n        else if (instruction.startsWith(\"cut\"))\n        {\n            int n = instruction.split(\" \").back.to!int;\n            cardPosition = (cardPosition - n + deckSize) % deckSize;\n        }\n        else if (instruction.startsWith(\"deal with increment\"))\n        {\n            int n = instruction.split(\" \").back.to!int;\n            cardPosition = (cardPosition * n) % deckSize;\n        }\n    }\n\n    writeln(cardPosition);\n}\n```\n"}]}

Not only do roundtrip signals to Earth take five hours, but the signal quality is quite bad as well. You can clean up the signal with the Flawed Frequency Transmission algorithm, or FFT.\n\nAs input, FFT takes a list of numbers. In the signal you received (your puzzle input), each number is a single digit: data like 15243 represents the sequence 1, 5, 2, 4, 3.\n\nFFT operates in repeated phases. In each phase, a new list is constructed with the same length as the input list. This new list is also used as the input for the next phase.\n\nEach element in the new list is built by multiplying every value in the input list by a value in a repeating pattern and then adding up the results. So, if the input list were 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and the pattern for a given element were 1, 2, 3, the result would be 9*1 + 8*2 + 7*3 + 6*1 + 5*2 (with each input element on the left and each value in the repeating pattern on the right of each multiplication). Then, only the ones digit is kept: 38 becomes 8, -17 becomes 7, and so on.\n\nWhile each element in the output array uses all of the same input array elements, the actual repeating pattern to use depends on which output element is being calculated. The base pattern is 0, 1, 0, -1. Then, repeat each value in the pattern a number of times equal to the position in the output list being considered. Repeat once for the first element, twice for the second element, three times for the third element, and so on. So, if the third element of the output list is being calculated, repeating the values would produce: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1.\n\nWhen applying the pattern, skip the very first value exactly once. (In other words, offset the whole pattern left by one.) So, for the second element of the output list, the actual pattern used would be: 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, ....\n\nAfter using this process to calculate each element of the output list, the phase is complete, and the output list of this phase is used as the new input list for the next phase, if any.\n\nGiven the input signal 12345678, below are four phases of FFT. Within each phase, each output digit is calculated on a single line with the result at the far right; each multiplication operation shows the input digit on the left and the pattern value on the right:\n\nInput signal: 12345678\n\n1*1  + 2*0  + 3*-1 + 4*0  + 5*1  + 6*0  + 7*-1 + 8*0  = 4\n1*0  + 2*1  + 3*1  + 4*0  + 5*0  + 6*-1 + 7*-1 + 8*0  = 8\n1*0  + 2*0  + 3*1  + 4*1  + 5*1  + 6*0  + 7*0  + 8*0  = 2\n1*0  + 2*0  + 3*0  + 4*1  + 5*1  + 6*1  + 7*1  + 8*0  = 2\n1*0  + 2*0  + 3*0  + 4*0  + 5*1  + 6*1  + 7*1  + 8*1  = 6\n1*0  + 2*0  + 3*0  + 4*0  + 5*0  + 6*1  + 7*1  + 8*1  = 1\n1*0  + 2*0  + 3*0  + 4*0  + 5*0  + 6*0  + 7*1  + 8*1  = 5\n1*0  + 2*0  + 3*0  + 4*0  + 5*0  + 6*0  + 7*0  + 8*1  = 8\n\nAfter 1 phase: 48226158\n\n4*1  + 8*0  + 2*-1 + 2*0  + 6*1  + 1*0  + 5*-1 + 8*0  = 3\n4*0  + 8*1  + 2*1  + 2*0  + 6*0  + 1*-1 + 5*-1 + 8*0  = 4\n4*0  + 8*0  + 2*1  + 2*1  + 6*1  + 1*0  + 5*0  + 8*0  = 0\n4*0  + 8*0  + 2*0  + 2*1  + 6*1  + 1*1  + 5*1  + 8*0  = 4\n4*0  + 8*0  + 2*0  + 2*0  + 6*1  + 1*1  + 5*1  + 8*1  = 0\n4*0  + 8*0  + 2*0  + 2*0  + 6*0  + 1*1  + 5*1  + 8*1  = 4\n4*0  + 8*0  + 2*0  + 2*0  + 6*0  + 1*0  + 5*1  + 8*1  = 3\n4*0  + 8*0  + 2*0  + 2*0  + 6*0  + 1*0  + 5*0  + 8*1  = 8\n\nAfter 2 phases: 34040438\n\n3*1  + 4*0  + 0*-1 + 4*0  + 0*1  + 4*0  + 3*-1 + 8*0  = 0\n3*0  + 4*1  + 0*1  + 4*0  + 0*0  + 4*-1 + 3*-1 + 8*0  = 3\n3*0  + 4*0  + 0*1  + 4*1  + 0*1  + 4*0  + 3*0  + 8*0  = 4\n3*0  + 4*0  + 0*0  + 4*1  + 0*1  + 4*1  + 3*1  + 8*0  = 1\n3*0  + 4*0  + 0*0  + 4*0  + 0*1  + 4*1  + 3*1  + 8*1  = 5\n3*0  + 4*0  + 0*0  + 4*0  + 0*0  + 4*1  + 3*1  + 8*1  = 5\n3*0  + 4*0  + 0*0  + 4*0  + 0*0  + 4*0  + 3*1  + 8*1  = 1\n3*0  + 4*0  + 0*0  + 4*0  + 0*0  + 4*0  + 3*0  + 8*1  = 8\n\nAfter 3 phases: 03415518\n\n0*1  + 3*0  + 4*-1 + 1*0  + 5*1  + 5*0  + 1*-1 + 8*0  = 0\n0*0  + 3*1  + 4*1  + 1*0  + 5*0  + 5*-1 + 1*-1 + 8*0  = 1\n0*0  + 3*0  + 4*1  + 1*1  + 5*1  + 5*0  + 1*0  + 8*0  = 0\n0*0  + 3*0  + 4*0  + 1*1  + 5*1  + 5*1  + 1*1  + 8*0  = 2\n0*0  + 3*0  + 4*0  + 1*0  + 5*1  + 5*1  + 1*1  + 8*1  = 9\n0*0  + 3*0  + 4*0  + 1*0  + 5*0  + 5*1  + 1*1  + 8*1  = 4\n0*0  + 3*0  + 4*0  + 1*0  + 5*0  + 5*0  + 1*1  + 8*1  = 9\n0*0  + 3*0  + 4*0  + 1*0  + 5*0  + 5*0  + 1*0  + 8*1  = 8\n\nAfter 4 phases: 01029498\nHere are the first eight digits of the final output list after 100 phases for some larger inputs:\n\n80871224585914546619083218645595 becomes 24176176.\n19617804207202209144916044189917 becomes 73745418.\n69317163492948606335995924319873 becomes 52432133.\nAfter 100 phases of FFT, what are the first eight digits in the final output list?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.file;\nimport std.conv;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    // Read input from file\n    string input = cast(string)std.file.read(\"input.txt\");\n\n    // Convert input string to array of integers\n    int[] digits;\n    foreach (char c; input)\n    {\n        digits ~= to!int(c.to!string);\n    }\n\n    // Apply FFT algorithm for 100 phases\n    foreach (_; 0 .. 100)\n    {\n        digits = applyFFT(digits);\n    }\n\n    // Output the first eight digits\n    foreach (i; 0 .. 8)\n    {\n        write(digits[i]);\n    }\n    writeln();\n}\n\nint[] applyFFT(int[] input)\n{\n    int[] basePattern = [0, 1, 0, -1];\n    int[] output = new int[input.length];\n    foreach (i, _; input)\n    {\n        int sum = 0;\n        foreach (j, val; input)\n        {\n            int patternValue = basePattern[((j + 1) / (i + 1)) % basePattern.length];\n            sum += val * patternValue;\n        }\n        output[i] = abs(sum % 10);\n    }\n    return output;\n}\n\nint abs(int x)\n{\n    return x < 0 ? -x : x;\n}\n```\n"}]}

You land your ship near the rover.\n\nWhen you reach the rover, you discover that it's already in the process of rebooting! It's just waiting for someone to enter a BIOS password. The Elf responsible for the rover takes a picture of the password (your puzzle input) and sends it to you via the Digital Sending Network.\n\nUnfortunately, images sent via the Digital Sending Network aren't encoded with any normal encoding; instead, they're encoded in a special Space Image Format. None of the Elves seem to remember why this is the case. They send you the instructions to decode it.\n\nImages are sent as a series of digits that each represent the color of a single pixel. The digits fill each row of the image left-to-right, then move downward to the next row, filling rows top-to-bottom until every pixel of the image is filled.\n\nEach image actually consists of a series of identically-sized layers that are filled in this way. So, the first digit corresponds to the top-left pixel of the first layer, the second digit corresponds to the pixel to the right of that on the same layer, and so on until the last digit, which corresponds to the bottom-right pixel of the last layer.\n\nFor example, given an image 3 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall, the image data 123456789012 corresponds to the following image layers:\n\nLayer 1: 123\n         456\n\nLayer 2: 789\n         012\nThe image you received is 25 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall.\n\nTo make sure the image wasn't corrupted during transmission, the Elves would like you to find the layer that contains the fewest 0 digits.

Because navigation in space often involves transferring between orbits, the orbit maps here are useful for finding efficient routes between, for example, you and Santa. You download a map of the local orbits (your puzzle input).\n\nExcept for the universal Center of Mass (COM), every object in space is in orbit around exactly one other object. An orbit looks roughly like this:\n\n                                                         |\n                    |\nAAA--> o            o <--BBB\n                    |\n                    |\n                   /\n                  /\nIn this diagram, the object BBB is in orbit around AAA. The path that BBB takes around AAA (drawn with lines) is only partly shown. In the map data, this orbital relationship is written AAA)BBB, which means \"BBB is in orbit around AAA\".\n\nBefore you use your map data to plot a course, you need to make sure it wasn't corrupted during the download. To verify maps, the Universal Orbit Map facility uses orbit count checksums - the total number of direct orbits (like the one shown above) and indirect orbits.\n\nWhenever A orbits B and B orbits C, then A indirectly orbits C.

Because navigation in space often involves transferring between orbits, the orbit maps here are useful for finding efficient routes between, for example, you and Santa. You download a map of the local orbits (your puzzle input).\n\nExcept for the universal Center of Mass (COM), every object in space is in orbit around exactly one other object. An orbit looks roughly like this:\n\n                                                         |\n                    |\nAAA--> o            o <--BBB\n                    |\n                    |\n                   /\n                  /\nIn this diagram, the object BBB is in orbit around AAA. The path that BBB takes around AAA (drawn with lines) is only partly shown. In the map data, this orbital relationship is written AAA)BBB, which means \"BBB is in orbit around AAA\".\n\nBefore you use your map data to plot a course, you need to make sure it wasn't corrupted during the download. To verify maps, the Universal Orbit Map facility uses orbit count checksums - the total number of direct orbits (like the one shown above) and indirect orbits.\n\nWhenever A orbits B and B orbits C, then A indirectly orbits C.

The Elves suggest that you get the air conditioner working by upgrading your ship computer to support the Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal.\n\nThe Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal (TEST) starts by running a diagnostic program (your puzzle input). The TEST diagnostic program will run on your existing Intcode computer after a few modifications:\n\nFirst, you'll need to add two new instructions:\n\nOpcode 3 takes a single integer as input and saves it to the position given by its only parameter. For example, the instruction 3,50 would take an input value and store it at address 50.\nOpcode 4 outputs the value of its only parameter. For example, the instruction 4,50 would output the value at address 50.\nPrograms that use these instructions will come with documentation that explains what should be connected to the input and output. The program 3,0,4,0,99 outputs whatever it gets as input, then halts.\n\nSecond, you'll need to add support for parameter modes:\n\nEach parameter of an instruction is handled based on its parameter mode. Right now, your ship computer already understands parameter mode 0, position mode, which causes the parameter to be interpreted as a position - if the parameter is 50, its value is the value stored at address 50 in memory. Until now, all parameters have been in position mode.\n\nNow, your ship computer will also need to handle parameters in mode 1, immediate mode. In immediate mode, a parameter is interpreted as a value - if the parameter is 50, its value is simply 50.\n\nParameter modes are stored in the same value as the instruction's opcode. The opcode is a two-digit number based only on the ones and tens digit of the value, that is, the opcode is the rightmost two digits of the first value in an instruction. Parameter modes are single digits, one per parameter, read right-to-left from the opcode: the first parameter's mode is in the hundreds digit, the second parameter's mode is in the thousands digit, the third parameter's mode is in the ten-thousands digit, and so on. Any missing modes are 0.\n\nFor example, consider the program 1002,4,3,4,33.\n\nThe first instruction, 1002,4,3,4, is a multiply instruction - the rightmost two digits of the first value, 02, indicate opcode 2, multiplication. Then, going right to left, the parameter modes are 0 (hundreds digit), 1 (thousands digit), and 0 (ten-thousands digit, not present and therefore zero):\n\nABCDE\n 1002\n\nDE - two-digit opcode,      02 == opcode 2\n C - mode of 1st parameter,  0 == position mode\n B - mode of 2nd parameter,  1 == immediate mode\n A - mode of 3rd parameter,  0 == position mode,\n                                  omitted due to being a leading zero\nThis instruction multiplies its first two parameters. The first parameter, 4 in position mode, works like it did before - its value is the value stored at address 4 (33). The second parameter, 3 in immediate mode, simply has value 3. The result of this operation, 33 * 3 = 99, is written according to the third parameter, 4 in position mode, which also works like it did before - 99 is written to address 4.\n\nParameters that an instruction writes to will never be in immediate mode.\n\nFinally, some notes:\n\nIt is important to remember that the instruction pointer should increase by the number of values in the instruction after the instruction finishes. Because of the new instructions, this amount is no longer always 4.\nIntegers can be negative: 1101,100,-1,4,0 is a valid program (find 100 + -1, store the result in position 4).\nThe TEST diagnostic program will start by requesting from the user the ID of the system to test by running an input instruction - provide it 1, the ID for the ship's air conditioner unit.\n\nIt will then perform a series of diagnostic tests confirming that various parts of the Intcode computer, like parameter modes, function correctly. For each test, it will run an output instruction indicating how far the result of the test was from the expected value, where 0 means the test was successful. Non-zero outputs mean that a function is not working correctly; check the instructions that were run before the output instruction to see which one failed.\n\nFinally, the program will output a diagnostic code and immediately halt. This final output isn't an error; an output followed immediately by a halt means the program finished. If all outputs were zero except the diagnostic code, the diagnostic program ran successfully.\n\nAfter providing 1 to the only input instruction and passing all the tests, what diagnostic code does the program produce?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 14522484.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe air conditioner comes online! Its cold air feels good for a while, but then the TEST alarms start to go off. Since the air conditioner can't vent its heat anywhere but back into the spacecraft, it's actually making the air inside the ship warmer.\n\nInstead, you'll need to use the TEST to extend the thermal radiators. Fortunately, the diagnostic program (your puzzle input) is already equipped for this. Unfortunately, your Intcode computer is not.\n\nYour computer is only missing a few opcodes:\n\nOpcode 5 is jump-if-true: if the first parameter is non-zero, it sets the instruction pointer to the value from the second parameter. Otherwise, it does nothing.\nOpcode 6 is jump-if-false: if the first parameter is zero, it sets the instruction pointer to the value from the second parameter. Otherwise, it does nothing.\nOpcode 7 is less than: if the first parameter is less than the second parameter, it stores 1 in the position given by the third parameter. Otherwise, it stores 0.\nOpcode 8 is equals: if the first parameter is equal to the second parameter, it stores 1 in the position given by the third parameter. Otherwise, it stores 0.\nLike all instructions, these instructions need to support parameter modes as described above.\n\nNormally, after an instruction is finished, the instruction pointer increases by the number of values in that instruction. However, if the instruction modifies the instruction pointer, that value is used and the instruction pointer is not automatically increased.\n\nFor example, here are several programs that take one input, compare it to the value 8, and then produce one output:\n\n3,9,8,9,10,9,4,9,99,-1,8 - Using position mode, consider whether the input is equal to 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).\n3,9,7,9,10,9,4,9,99,-1,8 - Using position mode, consider whether the input is less than 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).\n3,3,1108,-1,8,3,4,3,99 - Using immediate mode, consider whether the input is equal to 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).\n3,3,1107,-1,8,3,4,3,99 - Using immediate mode, consider whether the input is less than 8; output 1 (if it is) or 0 (if it is not).\nHere are some jump tests that take an input, then output 0 if the input was zero or 1 if the input was non-zero:\n\n3,12,6,12,15,1,13,14,13,4,13,99,-1,0,1,9 (using position mode)\n3,3,1105,-1,9,1101,0,0,12,4,12,99,1 (using immediate mode)\nHere's a larger example:\n\n3,21,1008,21,8,20,1005,20,22,107,8,21,20,1006,20,31,\n1106,0,36,98,0,0,1002,21,125,20,4,20,1105,1,46,104,\n999,1105,1,46,1101,1000,1,20,4,20,1105,1,46,98,99\nThe above example program uses an input instruction to ask for a single number. The program will then output 999 if the input value is below 8, output 1000 if the input value is equal to 8, or output 1001 if the input value is greater than 8.\n\nThis time, when the TEST diagnostic program runs its input instruction to get the ID of the system to test, provide it 5, the ID for the ship's thermal radiator controller. This diagnostic test suite only outputs one number, the diagnostic code.\n\nWhat is the diagnostic code for system ID 5?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.file;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.algorithm;\nimport std.string;\n\nint[] parseInput(string fileName) {\n    string input = readText(fileName).strip();\n    return input.split(\",\").map!(to!int).array;\n}\n\nint getParameterValue(in int[] memory, int parameter, int mode) {\n    return mode == 0 ? memory[parameter] : parameter;\n}\n\nvoid executeIntcode(int[] memory) {\n    int i = 0;\n    while (i < memory.length) {\n        int instruction = memory[i];\n        int opcode = instruction % 100;\n        int mode1 = (instruction / 100) % 10;\n        int mode2 = (instruction / 1000) % 10;\n\n        switch (opcode) {\n            case 1: // Addition\n                memory[memory[i+3]] = getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+1], mode1) + getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+2], mode2);\n                i += 4;\n                break;\n            case 2: // Multiplication\n                memory[memory[i+3]] = getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+1], mode1) * getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+2], mode2);\n                i += 4;\n                break;\n            case 3: // Input\n                memory[memory[i+1]] = 5; // Provide 5 as input for the ship's thermal radiator controller\n                i += 2;\n                break;\n            case 4: // Output\n                writeln(getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+1], mode1));\n                i += 2;\n                break;\n            case 5: // Jump-if-true\n                if (getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+1], mode1) != 0) {\n                    i = getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+2], mode2);\n                } else {\n                    i += 3;\n                }\n                break;\n            case 6: // Jump-if-false\n                if (getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+1], mode1) == 0) {\n                    i = getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+2], mode2);\n                } else {\n                    i += 3;\n                }\n                break;\n            case 7: // Less than\n                memory[memory[i+3]] = getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+1], mode1) < getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+2], mode2) ? 1 : 0;\n                i += 4;\n                break;\n            case 8: // Equals\n                memory[memory[i+3]] = getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+1], mode1) == getParameterValue(memory, memory[i+2], mode2) ? 1 : 0;\n                i += 4;\n                break;\n            case 99: // Halt\n                return;\n            default:\n                writeln(\"Error: Unknown opcode encountered: \", opcode);\n                return;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n    int[] memory = parseInput(\"input.txt\");\n    executeIntcode(memory);\n}\n```\n"}]}

On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: \"Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--\" The ship computer bursts into flames.\n\nYou notify the Elves that the computer's magic smoke seems to have escaped. \"That computer ran Intcode programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!\"\n\nAn Intcode program is a list of integers separated by commas (like 1,0,0,3,99). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position 0). Here, you will find an opcode - either 1, 2, or 99. The opcode indicates what to do; for example, 99 means that the program is finished and should immediately halt. Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.\n\nOpcode 1 adds together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.\n\nFor example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.\n\nOpcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.\n\nOnce you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following program:\n\n1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50\nFor the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:\n\n1,9,10,3,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nThe first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the output (3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:\n\n1,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStep forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively. Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:\n\n3500,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode 99, halting the program.\n\nHere are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:\n\n1,0,0,0,99 becomes 2,0,0,0,99 (1 + 1 = 2).\n2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,6,99 (3 * 2 = 6).\n2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,9801 (99 * 99 = 9801).\n1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99 becomes 30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99.\nOnce you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity assist program (your puzzle input) to the \"1202 program alarm\" state it had just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the value 2. What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 4714701.\n\n--- Part Two ---\n\"Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly! Keep it nearby during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what they are as you need them.\"\n\n\"However, your current priority should be to complete your gravity assist around the Moon. For this mission to succeed, we should settle on some terminology for the parts you've already built.\"\n\nIntcode programs are given as a list of integers; these values are used as the initial state for the computer's memory. When you run an Intcode program, make sure to start by initializing memory to the program's values. A position in memory is called an address (for example, the first value in memory is at \"address 0\").\n\nOpcodes (like 1, 2, or 99) mark the beginning of an instruction. The values used immediately after an opcode, if any, are called the instruction's parameters. For example, in the instruction 1,2,3,4, 1 is the opcode; 2, 3, and 4 are the parameters. The instruction 99 contains only an opcode and has no parameters.\n\nThe address of the current instruction is called the instruction pointer; it starts at 0. After an instruction finishes, the instruction pointer increases by the number of values in the instruction; until you add more instructions to the computer, this is always 4 (1 opcode + 3 parameters) for the add and multiply instructions. (The halt instruction would increase the instruction pointer by 1, but it halts the program instead.)\n\n\"With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the gravity assist, you need to determine what pair of inputs produces the output 19690720.\"\n\nThe inputs should still be provided to the program by replacing the values at addresses 1 and 2, just like before. In this program, the value placed in address 1 is called the noun, and the value placed in address 2 is called the verb. Each of the two input values will be between 0 and 99, inclusive.\n\nOnce the program has halted, its output is available at address 0, also just like before. Each time you try a pair of inputs, make sure you first reset the computer's memory to the values in the program (your puzzle input) - in other words, don't reuse memory from a previous attempt.\n\nFind the input noun and verb that cause the program to produce the output 19690720. What is 100 * noun + verb? (For example, if noun=12 and verb=2, the answer would be 1202.)\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.file;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.algorithm.iteration;\nimport std.string;\n\n// Function to run the Intcode program\nint runIntcode(int[] memory) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < memory.length; i += 4) {\n        switch (memory[i]) {\n            case 1:\n                memory[memory[i + 3]] = memory[memory[i + 1]] + memory[memory[i + 2]];\n                break;\n            case 2:\n                memory[memory[i + 3]] = memory[memory[i + 1]] * memory[memory[i + 2]];\n                break;\n            case 99:\n                return memory[0];\n            default:\n                writeln(\"Error: Unknown opcode encountered.\");\n                return -1; // Indicate error\n        }\n    }\n    return -1; // Indicate error if exited loop without halting\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n    // Read and prepare the Intcode program\n    string input = readText(\"input.txt\").strip();\n    int[] originalMemory = input.split(\",\").map!(a => to!int(a)).array();\n\n    // Desired output\n    const int targetOutput = 19690720;\n\n    // Try all combinations of noun and verb\n    foreach (int noun; 0 .. 100) {\n        foreach (int verb; 0 .. 100) {\n            // Reset memory to initial state and set noun and verb\n            int[] memory = originalMemory.dup; // Duplicate the original memory for each attempt\n            memory[1] = noun;\n            memory[2] = verb;\n\n            // Run the program with current noun and verb\n            int output = runIntcode(memory);\n\n            // Check if the output matches the target\n            if (output == targetOutput) {\n                // Calculate and print the answer\n                writeln(100 * noun + verb);\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n"}]}

On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: \"Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--\" The ship computer bursts into flames.\n\nYou notify the Elves that the computer's magic smoke seems to have escaped. \"That computer ran Intcode programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!\"\n\nAn Intcode program is a list of integers separated by commas (like 1,0,0,3,99). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position 0). Here, you will find an opcode - either 1, 2, or 99. The opcode indicates what to do; for example, 99 means that the program is finished and should immediately halt. Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.\n\nOpcode 1 adds together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.\n\nFor example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.\n\nOpcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.\n\nOnce you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following program:\n\n1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50\nFor the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:\n\n1,9,10,3,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nThe first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the output (3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:\n\n1,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStep forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively. Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:\n\n3500,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode 99, halting the program.\n\nHere are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:\n\n1,0,0,0,99 becomes 2,0,0,0,99 (1 + 1 = 2).\n2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,6,99 (3 * 2 = 6).\n2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,9801 (99 * 99 = 9801).\n1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99 becomes 30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99.\nOnce you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity assist program (your puzzle input) to the \"1202 program alarm\" state it had just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the value 2. What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.file;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.algorithm.iteration;\nimport std.string;\n\nvoid main() {\n    // Read the Intcode program from input.txt and strip whitespace\n    string input = readText(\"input.txt\").strip();\n    // Convert the string of numbers into an array of integers\n    int[] codes = input.split(\",\").map!(a => to!int(a)).array();\n\n    // Restore the gravity assist program to the \"1202 program alarm\" state\n    codes[1] = 12;\n    codes[2] = 2;\n\n    // Process the Intcode program\n    for (int i = 0; i < codes.length; i += 4) {\n        switch (codes[i]) {\n            case 1:\n                // Addition\n                codes[codes[i+3]] = codes[codes[i+1]] + codes[codes[i+2]];\n                break;\n            case 2:\n                // Multiplication\n                codes[codes[i+3]] = codes[codes[i+1]] * codes[codes[i+2]];\n                break;\n            case 99:\n                // Halt\n                writeln(codes[0]);\n                return;\n            default:\n                // Unknown opcode\n                writeln(\"Error: Unknown opcode encountered.\");\n                return;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n"}]}

To find it, individually calculate the fuel needed for the mass of each module (your puzzle input), then add together all the fuel values.\n\nWhat is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 3465154.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nDuring the second Go / No Go poll, the Elf in charge of the Rocket Equation Double-Checker stops the launch sequence. Apparently, you forgot to include additional fuel for the fuel you just added.\n\nFuel itself requires fuel just like a module - take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2. However, that fuel also requires fuel, and that fuel requires fuel, and so on. Any mass that would require negative fuel should instead be treated as if it requires zero fuel; the remaining mass, if any, is instead handled by wishing really hard, which has no mass and is outside the scope of this calculation.\n\nSo, for each module mass, calculate its fuel and add it to the total. Then, treat the fuel amount you just calculated as the input mass and repeat the process, continuing until a fuel requirement is zero or negative. For example:\n\nA module of mass 14 requires 2 fuel. This fuel requires no further fuel (2 divided by 3 and rounded down is 0, which would call for a negative fuel), so the total fuel required is still just 2.\nAt first, a module of mass 1969 requires 654 fuel. Then, this fuel requires 216 more fuel (654 / 3 - 2). 216 then requires 70 more fuel, which requires 21 fuel, which requires 5 fuel, which requires no further fuel. So, the total fuel required for a module of mass 1969 is 654 + 216 + 70 + 21 + 5 = 966.\nThe fuel required by a module of mass 100756 and its fuel is: 33583 + 11192 + 3728 + 1240 + 411 + 135 + 43 + 12 + 2 = 50346.\nWhat is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft when also taking into account the mass of the added fuel?

Immediately, the device deploys hundreds of tiny nanobots which fly around the cavern, apparently assembling themselves into a very specific formation. The device lists the X,Y,Z position (pos) for each nanobot as well as its signal radius (r) on its tiny screen (your puzzle input).\n\nEach nanobot can transmit signals to any integer coordinate which is a distance away from it less than or equal to its signal radius (as measured by Manhattan distance). Coordinates a distance away of less than or equal to a nanobot's signal radius are said to be in range of that nanobot.\n\nBefore you start the teleportation process, you should determine which nanobot is the strongest (that is, which has the largest signal radius) and then, for that nanobot, the total number of nanobots that are in range of it, including itself.\n\nFor example, given the following nanobots:\n\npos=<0,0,0>, r=4\npos=<1,0,0>, r=1\npos=<4,0,0>, r=3\npos=<0,2,0>, r=1\npos=<0,5,0>, r=3\npos=<0,0,3>, r=1\npos=<1,1,1>, r=1\npos=<1,1,2>, r=1\npos=<1,3,1>, r=1\nThe strongest nanobot is the first one (position 0,0,0) because its signal radius, 4 is the largest.

The device's manual goes on to explain:\n\n\"In programs where flow control is required, the instruction pointer can be bound to a register so that it can be manipulated directly. This way, setr/seti can function as absolute jumps, addr/addi can function as relative jumps, and other opcodes can cause truly fascinating effects.\"\n\nThis mechanism is achieved through a declaration like #ip 1, which would modify register 1 so that accesses to it let the program indirectly access the instruction pointer itself. To compensate for this kind of binding, there are now six registers (numbered 0 through 5); the five not bound to the instruction pointer behave as normal. Otherwise, the same rules apply as the last time you worked with this device.\n\nWhen the instruction pointer is bound to a register, its value is written to that register just before each instruction is executed, and the value of that register is written back to the instruction pointer immediately after each instruction finishes execution. Afterward, move to the next instruction by adding one to the instruction pointer, even if the value in the instruction pointer was just updated by an instruction. (Because of this, instructions must effectively set the instruction pointer to the instruction before the one they want executed next.)\n\nThe instruction pointer is 0 during the first instruction, 1 during the second, and so on. If the instruction pointer ever causes the device to attempt to load an instruction outside the instructions defined in the program, the program instead immediately halts. The instruction pointer starts at 0.\n\nIt turns out that this new information is already proving useful: the CPU in the device is not very powerful, and a background process is occupying most of its time. You dump the background process' declarations and instructions to a file (your puzzle input), making sure to use the names of the opcodes rather than the numbers.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following program:\n\n#ip 0\nseti 5 0 1\nseti 6 0 2\naddi 0 1 0\naddr 1 2 3\nsetr 1 0 0\nseti 8 0 4\nseti 9 0 5\nWhen executed, the following instructions are executed. Each line contains the value of the instruction pointer at the time the instruction started, the values of the six registers before executing the instructions (in square brackets), the instruction itself, and the values of the six registers after executing the instruction (also in square brackets).\n\nip=0 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] seti 5 0 1 [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nip=1 [1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] seti 6 0 2 [1, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nip=2 [2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0] addi 0 1 0 [3, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nip=4 [4, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0] setr 1 0 0 [5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nip=6 [6, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0] seti 9 0 5 [6, 5, 6, 0, 0, 9]\nIn detail, when running this program, the following events occur:\n\nThe first line (#ip 0) indicates that the instruction pointer should be bound to register 0 in this program. This is not an instruction, and so the value of the instruction pointer does not change during the processing of this line.\nThe instruction pointer contains 0, and so the first instruction is executed (seti 5 0 1). It updates register 0 to the current instruction pointer value (0), sets register 1 to 5, sets the instruction pointer to the value of register 0 (which has no effect, as the instruction did not modify register 0), and then adds one to the instruction pointer.\nThe instruction pointer contains 1, and so the second instruction, seti 6 0 2, is executed. This is very similar to the instruction before it: 6 is stored in register 2, and the instruction pointer is left with the value 2.\nThe instruction pointer is 2, which points at the instruction addi 0 1 0. This is like a relative jump: the value of the instruction pointer, 2, is loaded into register 0. Then, addi finds the result of adding the value in register 0 and the value 1, storing the result, 3, back in register 0. Register 0 is then copied back to the instruction pointer, which will cause it to end up 1 larger than it would have otherwise and skip the next instruction (addr 1 2 3) entirely. Finally, 1 is added to the instruction pointer.\nThe instruction pointer is 4, so the instruction setr 1 0 0 is run. This is like an absolute jump: it copies the value contained in register 1, 5, into register 0, which causes it to end up in the instruction pointer. The instruction pointer is then incremented, leaving it at 6.\nThe instruction pointer is 6, so the instruction seti 9 0 5 stores 9 into register 5. The instruction pointer is incremented, causing it to point outside the program, and so the program ends.\nWhat value is left in register 0 when the background process halts?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.file;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.stdio;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    string input = cast(string) read(\"input.txt\");\n    string[] lines = input.split(\"\\n\");\n\n    int ipRegister = lines[0].split(\" \")[1].to!int;\n    lines = lines[1..$];\n\n    int[] registers = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];\n\n    while (registers[ipRegister] < lines.length)\n    {\n        string line = lines[registers[ipRegister]];\n        string[] parts = line.split(\" \");\n        string op = parts[0];\n        int a = parts[1].to!int;\n        int b = parts[2].to!int;\n        int c = parts[3].to!int;\n\n        switch (op)\n        {\n            case \"addr\": registers[c] = registers[a] + registers[b]; break;\n            case \"addi\": registers[c] = registers[a] + b; break;\n            case \"mulr\": registers[c] = registers[a] * registers[b]; break;\n            case \"muli\": registers[c] = registers[a] * b; break;\n            case \"banr\": registers[c] = registers[a] & registers[b]; break;\n            case \"bani\": registers[c] = registers[a] & b; break;\n            case \"borr\": registers[c] = registers[a] | registers[b]; break;\n            case \"bori\": registers[c] = registers[a] | b; break;\n            case \"setr\": registers[c] = registers[a]; break;\n            case \"seti\": registers[c] = a; break;\n            case \"gtir\": registers[c] = a > registers[b] ? 1 : 0; break;\n            case \"gtri\": registers[c] = registers[a] > b ? 1 : 0; break;\n            case \"gtrr\": registers[c] = registers[a] > registers[b] ? 1 : 0; break;\n            case \"eqir\": registers[c] = a == registers[b] ? 1 : 0; break;\n            case \"eqri\": registers[c] = registers[a] == b ? 1 : 0; break;\n            case \"eqrr\": registers[c] = registers[a] == registers[b] ? 1 : 0; break;\n            default: assert(0);\n        }\n\n        registers[ipRegister]++;\n    }\n\n    writeln(registers[0]);\n}\n```\n"}]}

Chocolate, cinnamon, mint, chili peppers, nutmeg, vanilla... the Elves must be growing these plants to make hot chocolate! As you realize this, you hear a conversation in the distance. When you go to investigate, you discover two Elves in what appears to be a makeshift underground kitchen/laboratory.\n\nThe Elves are trying to come up with the ultimate hot chocolate recipe; they're even maintaining a scoreboard which tracks the quality score (0-9) of each recipe.\n\nOnly two recipes are on the board: the first recipe got a score of 3, the second, 7. Each of the two Elves has a current recipe: the first Elf starts with the first recipe, and the second Elf starts with the second recipe.\n\nTo create new recipes, the two Elves combine their current recipes. This creates new recipes from the digits of the sum of the current recipes' scores. With the current recipes' scores of 3 and 7, their sum is 10, and so two new recipes would be created: the first with score 1 and the second with score 0. If the current recipes' scores were 2 and 3, the sum, 5, would only create one recipe (with a score of 5) with its single digit.\n\nThe new recipes are added to the end of the scoreboard in the order they are created. So, after the first round, the scoreboard is 3, 7, 1, 0.\n\nAfter all new recipes are added to the scoreboard, each Elf picks a new current recipe. To do this, the Elf steps forward through the scoreboard a number of recipes equal to 1 plus the score of their current recipe. So, after the first round, the first Elf moves forward 1 + 3 = 4 times, while the second Elf moves forward 1 + 7 = 8 times. If they run out of recipes, they loop back around to the beginning. After the first round, both Elves happen to loop around until they land on the same recipe that they had in the beginning; in general, they will move to different recipes.\n\nDrawing the first Elf as parentheses and the second Elf as square brackets, they continue this process:\n\n(3)[7]\n(3)[7] 1  0 \n 3  7  1 [0](1) 0 \n 3  7  1  0 [1] 0 (1)\n(3) 7  1  0  1  0 [1] 2 \n 3  7  1  0 (1) 0  1  2 [4]\n 3  7  1 [0] 1  0 (1) 2  4  5 \n 3  7  1  0 [1] 0  1  2 (4) 5  1 \n 3 (7) 1  0  1  0 [1] 2  4  5  1  5 \n 3  7  1  0  1  0  1  2 [4](5) 1  5  8 \n 3 (7) 1  0  1  0  1  2  4  5  1  5  8 [9]\n 3  7  1  0  1  0  1 [2] 4 (5) 1  5  8  9  1  6 \n 3  7  1  0  1  0  1  2  4  5 [1] 5  8  9  1 (6) 7 \n 3  7  1  0 (1) 0  1  2  4  5  1  5 [8] 9  1  6  7  7 \n 3  7 [1] 0  1  0 (1) 2  4  5  1  5  8  9  1  6  7  7  9 \n 3  7  1  0 [1] 0  1  2 (4) 5  1  5  8  9  1  6  7  7  9  2 \nThe Elves think their skill will improve after making a few recipes (your puzzle input). However, that could take ages; you can speed this up considerably by identifying the scores of the ten recipes after that. For example:\n\nIf the Elves think their skill will improve after making 9 recipes, the scores of the ten recipes after the first nine on the scoreboard would be 5158916779 (highlighted in the last line of the diagram).\nAfter 5 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 0124515891.\nAfter 18 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 9251071085.\nAfter 2018 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 5941429882.\nWhat are the scores of the ten recipes immediately after the number of recipes in your puzzle input?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.file;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.stdio;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    string input = cast(string) read(\"input.txt\");\n\n    int recipes = to!int(input);\n\n    int[] scoreboard = [3, 7];\n    int elf1 = 0;\n    int elf2 = 1;\n\n    while(scoreboard.length < recipes + 10)\n    {\n        int sum = scoreboard[elf1] + scoreboard[elf2];\n        if(sum >= 10)\n        {\n            scoreboard ~= sum / 10;\n            scoreboard ~= sum % 10;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            scoreboard ~= sum;\n        }\n\n        elf1 = (elf1 + 1 + scoreboard[elf1]) % cast(int)scoreboard.length;\n        elf2 = (elf2 + 1 + scoreboard[elf2]) % cast(int)scoreboard.length;\n    }\n\n    string result = \"\";\n    foreach(i; 0..10)\n    {\n        result ~= to!string(scoreboard[recipes + i]);\n    }\n\n    writeln(result);\n}\n```\n"}]}

The falling sensation returns.\n\nThe low fuel warning light is illuminated on your wrist-mounted device. Tapping it once causes it to project a hologram of the situation: a 300x300 grid of fuel cells and their current power levels, some negative. You're not sure what negative power means in the context of time travel, but it can't be good.\n\nEach fuel cell has a coordinate ranging from 1 to 300 in both the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) direction. In X,Y notation, the top-left cell is 1,1, and the top-right cell is 300,1.\n\nThe interface lets you select any 3x3 square of fuel cells. To increase your chances of getting to your destination, you decide to choose the 3x3 square with the largest total power.\n\nThe power level in a given fuel cell can be found through the following process:\n\nFind the fuel cell's rack ID, which is its X coordinate plus 10.\nBegin with a power level of the rack ID times the Y coordinate.\nIncrease the power level by the value of the grid serial number (your puzzle input).\nSet the power level to itself multiplied by the rack ID.\nKeep only the hundreds digit of the power level (so 12345 becomes 3; numbers with no hundreds digit become 0).\nSubtract 5 from the power level.\nFor example, to find the power level of the fuel cell at 3,5 in a grid with serial number 8:\n\nThe rack ID is 3 + 10 = 13.\nThe power level starts at 13 * 5 = 65.\nAdding the serial number produces 65 + 8 = 73.\nMultiplying by the rack ID produces 73 * 13 = 949.\nThe hundreds digit of 949 is 9.\nSubtracting 5 produces 9 - 5 = 4.\nSo, the power level of this fuel cell is 4.\n\nHere are some more example power levels:\n\nFuel cell at  122,79, grid serial number 57: power level -5.\nFuel cell at 217,196, grid serial number 39: power level  0.\nFuel cell at 101,153, grid serial number 71: power level  4.\nYour goal is to find the 3x3 square which has the largest total power. The square must be entirely within the 300x300 grid. Identify this square using the X,Y coordinate of its top-left fuel cell. For example:\n\nFor grid serial number 18, the largest total 3x3 square has a top-left corner of 33,45 (with a total power of 29); these fuel cells appear in the middle of this 5x5 region:\n\n-2  -4   4   4   4\n-4   4   4   4  -5\n 4   3   3   4  -4\n 1   1   2   4  -3\n-1   0   2  -5  -2\nFor grid serial number 42, the largest 3x3 square's top-left is 21,61 (with a total power of 30); they are in the middle of this region:\n\n-3   4   2   2   2\n-4   4   3   3   4\n-5   3   3   4  -4\n 4   3   3   4  -3\n 3   3   3  -5  -1\nWhat is the X,Y coordinate of the top-left fuel cell of the 3x3 square with the largest total power?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.file;\nimport std.string;\nimport std.conv;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    string data = cast(string)read(\"input.txt\");\n    int serial = data.strip.to!int;\n\n    int gridSize = 300;\n    int[][] grid;\n    grid.length = gridSize;\n    foreach (ref row; grid)\n    {\n        row.length = gridSize;\n    }\n\n    foreach (y; 0 .. gridSize)\n    {\n        foreach (x; 0 .. gridSize)\n        {\n            int rackID = x + 11;\n            int powerLevel = rackID * (y + 1);\n            powerLevel += serial;\n            powerLevel *= rackID;\n            powerLevel = (powerLevel / 100) % 10;\n            powerLevel -= 5;\n            grid[y][x] = powerLevel;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int maxPower = -1 << 31;\n    int maxX, maxY;\n    foreach (y; 0 .. gridSize-2)\n    {\n        foreach (x; 0 .. gridSize-2)\n        {\n            int totalPower = 0;\n            foreach (dy; 0 .. 3)\n            {\n                foreach (dx; 0 .. 3)\n                {\n                    totalPower += grid[y+dy][x+dx];\n                }\n            }\n            if (totalPower > maxPower)\n            {\n                maxPower = totalPower;\n                maxX = x + 1;\n                maxY = y + 1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    writeln(maxX, \",\", maxY);\n}\n```\n"}]}

To pass the time, they introduce you to their favorite marble game.\n\nThe Elves play this game by taking turns arranging the marbles in a circle according to very particular rules. The marbles are numbered starting with 0 and increasing by 1 until every marble has a number.\n\nFirst, the marble numbered 0 is placed in the circle. At this point, while it contains only a single marble, it is still a circle: the marble is both clockwise from itself and counter-clockwise from itself. This marble is designated the current marble.\n\nThen, each Elf takes a turn placing the lowest-numbered remaining marble into the circle between the marbles that are 1 and 2 marbles clockwise of the current marble. (When the circle is large enough, this means that there is one marble between the marble that was just placed and the current marble.) The marble that was just placed then becomes the current marble.\n\nHowever, if the marble that is about to be placed has a number which is a multiple of 23, something entirely different happens. First, the current player keeps the marble they would have placed, adding it to their score. In addition, the marble 7 marbles counter-clockwise from the current marble is removed from the circle and also added to the current player's score. The marble located immediately clockwise of the marble that was removed becomes the new current marble.\n\nFor example, suppose there are 9 players. After the marble with value 0 is placed in the middle, each player (shown in square brackets) takes a turn. The result of each of those turns would produce circles of marbles like this, where clockwise is to the right and the resulting current marble is in parentheses:\n\n[-] (0)\n[1]  0 (1)\n[2]  0 (2) 1 \n[3]  0  2  1 (3)\n[4]  0 (4) 2  1  3 \n[5]  0  4  2 (5) 1  3 \n[6]  0  4  2  5  1 (6) 3 \n[7]  0  4  2  5  1  6  3 (7)\n[8]  0 (8) 4  2  5  1  6  3  7 \n[9]  0  8  4 (9) 2  5  1  6  3  7 \n[1]  0  8  4  9  2(10) 5  1  6  3  7 \n[2]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5(11) 1  6  3  7 \n[3]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1(12) 6  3  7 \n[4]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6(13) 3  7 \n[5]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3(14) 7 \n[6]  0  8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7(15)\n[7]  0(16) 8  4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[8]  0 16  8(17) 4  9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[9]  0 16  8 17  4(18) 9  2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[1]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9(19) 2 10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[2]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9 19  2(20)10  5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[3]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9 19  2 20 10(21) 5 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[4]  0 16  8 17  4 18  9 19  2 20 10 21  5(22)11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[5]  0 16  8 17  4 18(19) 2 20 10 21  5 22 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[6]  0 16  8 17  4 18 19  2(24)20 10 21  5 22 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15 \n[7]  0 16  8 17  4 18 19  2 24 20(25)10 21  5 22 11  1 12  6 13  3 14  7 15\nThe goal is to be the player with the highest score after the last marble is used up.

Chronal interference detected. Please specify new target coordinates.\"\n\nThe device then produces a list of coordinates (your puzzle input). Are they places it thinks are safe or dangerous? It recommends you check manual page 729. The Elves did not give you a manual.\n\nIf they're dangerous, maybe you can minimize the danger by finding the coordinate that gives the largest distance from the other points.\n\nUsing only the Manhattan distance, determine the area around each coordinate by counting the number of integer X,Y locations that are closest to that coordinate (and aren't tied in distance to any other coordinate).\n\nYour goal is to find the size of the largest area that isn't infinite. For example, consider the following list of coordinates:\n\n1, 1\n1, 6\n8, 3\n3, 4\n5, 5\n8, 9\nIf we name these coordinates A through F, we can draw them on a grid, putting 0,0 at the top left:\n\n..........\n.A........\n..........\n........C.\n...D......\n.....E....\n.B........\n..........\n..........\n........F.\nThis view is partial - the actual grid extends infinitely in all directions. Using the Manhattan distance, each location's closest coordinate can be determined, shown here in lowercase:\n\naaaaa.cccc\naAaaa.cccc\naaaddecccc\naadddeccCc\n..dDdeeccc\nbb.deEeecc\nbBb.eeee..\nbbb.eeefff\nbbb.eeffff\nbbb.ffffFf\nLocations shown as . are equally far from two or more coordinates, and so they don't count as being closest to any.\n\nIn this example, the areas of coordinates A, B, C, and F are infinite - while not shown here, their areas extend forever outside the visible grid. However, the areas of coordinates D and E are finite: D is closest to 9 locations, and E is closest to 17 (both including the coordinate's location itself). Therefore, in this example, the size of the largest area is 17.\n\nWhat is the size of the largest area that isn't infinite?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 4016.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nOn the other hand, if the coordinates are safe, maybe the best you can do is try to find a region near as many coordinates as possible.\n\nFor example, suppose you want the sum of the Manhattan distance to all of the coordinates to be less than 32. For each location, add up the distances to all of the given coordinates; if the total of those distances is less than 32, that location is within the desired region. Using the same coordinates as above, the resulting region looks like this:\n\n..........\n.A........\n..........\n...###..C.\n..#D###...\n..###E#...\n.B.###....\n..........\n..........\n........F.\nIn particular, consider the highlighted location 4,3 located at the top middle of the region. Its calculation is as follows, where abs() is the absolute value function:\n\nDistance to coordinate A: abs(4-1) + abs(3-1) =  5\nDistance to coordinate B: abs(4-1) + abs(3-6) =  6\nDistance to coordinate C: abs(4-8) + abs(3-3) =  4\nDistance to coordinate D: abs(4-3) + abs(3-4) =  2\nDistance to coordinate E: abs(4-5) + abs(3-5) =  3\nDistance to coordinate F: abs(4-8) + abs(3-9) = 10\nTotal distance: 5 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 10 = 30\nBecause the total distance to all coordinates (30) is less than 32, the location is within the region.\n\nThis region, which also includes coordinates D and E, has a total size of 16.\n\nYour actual region will need to be much larger than this example, though, instead including all locations with a total distance of less than 10000.\n\nWhat is the size of the region containing all locations which have a total distance to all given coordinates of less than 10000?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.algorithm;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.file;\nimport std.range;\nimport std.string;\nimport std.typecons;\nimport std.math; // Added import for math module\n\nstruct Point {\n    int x, y;\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n    auto input = \"input.txt\".readText().splitter(\"\\n\").array;\n    Point[] points;\n    foreach (line; input) {\n        auto coords = line.split(\", \");\n        points ~= Point(to!int(coords[0]), to!int(coords[1]));\n    }\n\n    int minX = points.map!(p => p.x).minElement;\n    int maxX = points.map!(p => p.x).maxElement;\n    int minY = points.map!(p => p.y).minElement;\n    int maxY = points.map!(p => p.y).maxElement;\n\n    int regionSize = 0;\n    foreach (y; minY .. maxY + 1) {\n        foreach (x; minX .. maxX + 1) {\n            int totalDistance = points.map!(p => abs(x - p.x) + abs(y - p.y)).sum;\n            if (totalDistance < 10000) {\n                regionSize++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    writeln(regionSize);\n}\n```\n"}]}

The grid computing cluster is a seemingly-infinite two-dimensional grid of compute nodes. Each node is either clean or infected by the virus.\n\nTo prevent overloading the nodes (which would render them useless to the virus) or detection by system administrators, exactly one virus carrier moves through the network, infecting or cleaning nodes as it moves. The virus carrier is always located on a single node in the network (the current node) and keeps track of the direction it is facing.\n\nTo avoid detection, the virus carrier works in bursts; in each burst, it wakes up, does some work, and goes back to sleep. The following steps are all executed in order one time each burst:\n\nIf the current node is infected, it turns to its right. Otherwise, it turns to its left. (Turning is done in-place; the current node does not change.)\nIf the current node is clean, it becomes infected. Otherwise, it becomes cleaned. (This is done after the node is considered for the purposes of changing direction.)\nThe virus carrier moves forward one node in the direction it is facing.\nDiagnostics have also provided a map of the node infection status (your puzzle input). Clean nodes are shown as .; infected nodes are shown as #. This map only shows the center of the grid; there are many more nodes beyond those shown, but none of them are currently infected.\n\nThe virus carrier begins in the middle of the map facing up.\n\nFor example, suppose you are given a map like this:\n\n..#\n#..\n...\nThen, the middle of the infinite grid looks like this, with the virus carrier's position marked with [ ]:\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . # . . .\n. . . #[.]. . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\nThe virus carrier is on a clean node, so it turns left, infects the node, and moves left:\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . # . . .\n. . .[#]# . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\nThe virus carrier is on an infected node, so it turns right, cleans the node, and moves up:\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . .[.]. # . . .\n. . . . # . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\nFour times in a row, the virus carrier finds a clean, infects it, turns left, and moves forward, ending in the same place and still facing up:\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . #[#]. # . . .\n. . # # # . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\nNow on the same node as before, it sees an infection, which causes it to turn right, clean the node, and move forward:\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . # .[.]# . . .\n. . # # # . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\nAfter the above actions, a total of 7 bursts of activity had taken place.

For each particle, it provides the X, Y, and Z coordinates for the particle's position (p), velocity (v), and acceleration (a), each in the format <X,Y,Z>.\n\nEach tick, all particles are updated simultaneously. A particle's properties are updated in the following order:\n\nIncrease the X velocity by the X acceleration.\nIncrease the Y velocity by the Y acceleration.\nIncrease the Z velocity by the Z acceleration.\nIncrease the X position by the X velocity.\nIncrease the Y position by the Y velocity.\nIncrease the Z position by the Z velocity.\nBecause of seemingly tenuous rationale involving z-buffering, the GPU would like to know which particle will stay closest to position <0,0,0> in the long term. Measure this using the Manhattan distance, which in this situation is simply the sum of the absolute values of a particle's X, Y, and Z position.\n\nFor example, suppose you are only given two particles, both of which stay entirely on the X-axis (for simplicity).

A layer at depth 0 begins immediately inside the firewall; a layer at depth 1 would start immediately after that.\n\nFor example, suppose you've recorded the following:\n\n0: 3\n1: 2\n4: 4\n6: 4\nThis means that there is a layer immediately inside the firewall (with range 3), a second layer immediately after that (with range 2), a third layer which begins at depth 4 (with range 4), and a fourth layer which begins at depth 6 (also with range 4). Visually, it might look like this:\n\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[ ] [ ] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]\n[ ] [ ]         [ ]     [ ]\n[ ]             [ ]     [ ]\n              [ ]     [ ]\nWithin each layer, a security scanner moves back and forth within its range. Each security scanner starts at the top and moves down until it reaches the bottom, then moves up until it reaches the top, and repeats. A security scanner takes one picosecond to move one step. Drawing scanners as S, the first few picoseconds look like this:\n\n\nPicosecond 0:\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[S] [S] ... ... [S] ... [S]\n[ ] [ ]         [ ]     [ ]\n[ ]             [ ]     [ ]\n              [ ]     [ ]\n\nPicosecond 1:\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[ ] [ ] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]\n[S] [S]         [S]     [S]\n[ ]             [ ]     [ ]\n              [ ]     [ ]\n\nPicosecond 2:\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[ ] [S] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]\n[ ] [ ]         [ ]     [ ]\n[S]             [S]     [S]\n              [ ]     [ ]\n\nPicosecond 3:\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[ ] [ ] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]\n[S] [S]         [ ]     [ ]\n[ ]             [ ]     [ ]\n              [S]     [S]\nYour plan is to hitch a ride on a packet about to move through the firewall. The packet will travel along the top of each layer, and it moves at one layer per picosecond. Each picosecond, the packet moves one layer forward (its first move takes it into layer 0), and then the scanners move one step. If there is a scanner at the top of the layer as your packet enters it, you are caught. (If a scanner moves into the top of its layer while you are there, you are not caught: it doesn't have time to notice you before you leave.) If you were to do this in the configuration above, marking your current position with parentheses, your passage through the firewall would look like this:\n\nInitial state:\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[S] [S] ... ...

You are not caught in layer 1, since the scanner moved into the top of the layer once you were already there.\n\nThe severity of getting caught on a layer is equal to its depth multiplied by its range. (Ignore layers in which you do not get caught.) The severity of the whole trip is the sum of these values. In the example above, the trip severity is 0*3 + 6*4 = 24.\n\nGiven the details of the firewall you've recorded, if you leave immediately, what is the severity of your whole trip?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.file;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.algorithm;\nimport std.stdio; // Added import statement for writeln\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    string input = cast(string) read(\"input.txt\");\n    auto lines = input.split(\"\\n\");\n\n    int severity = 0;\n\n    foreach (line; lines)\n    {\n        auto parts = line.split(\": \");\n        int depth = to!int(parts[0]);\n        int range = to!int(parts[1]);\n\n        if (depth % ((range - 1) * 2) == 0)\n        {\n            severity += depth * range;\n        }\n    }\n\n    writeln(severity);\n}\n```\n"}]}

The hash these programs are implementing isn't very strong, but you decide to help them anyway. You make a mental note to remind the Elves later not to invent their own cryptographic functions.\n\nThis hash function simulates tying a knot in a circle of string with 256 marks on it. Based on the input to be hashed, the function repeatedly selects a span of string, brings the ends together, and gives the span a half-twist to reverse the order of the marks within it. After doing this many times, the order of the marks is used to build the resulting hash.\n\n4--5   pinch   4  5           4   1\n/      5,0,1  / /   twist  /  / 3      0  -->  3      0  -->  3   X   0\n    /          / /          /  /\n2--1           2  1           2   5\nTo achieve this, begin with a list of numbers from 0 to 255, a current position which begins at 0 (the first element in the list), a skip size (which starts at 0), and a sequence of lengths (your puzzle input). Then, for each length:\n\nReverse the order of that length of elements in the list, starting with the element at the current position.\nMove the current position forward by that length plus the skip size.\nIncrease the skip size by one.\nThe list is circular; if the current position and the length try to reverse elements beyond the end of the list, the operation reverses using as many extra elements as it needs from the front of the list. If the current position moves past the end of the list, it wraps around to the front. Lengths larger than the size of the list are invalid.\n\nHere's an example using a smaller list:\n\nSuppose we instead only had a circular list containing five elements, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and were given input lengths of 3, 4, 1, 5.\n\nThe list begins as [0] 1 2 3 4 (where square brackets indicate the current position).\nThe first length, 3, selects ([0] 1 2) 3 4 (where parentheses indicate the sublist to be reversed).\nAfter reversing that section (0 1 2 into 2 1 0), we get ([2] 1 0) 3 4.\nThen, the current position moves forward by the length, 3, plus the skip size, 0: 2 1 0 [3] 4. Finally, the skip size increases to 1.\nThe second length, 4, selects a section which wraps: 2 1) 0 ([3] 4.\nThe sublist 3 4 2 1 is reversed to form 1 2 4 3: 4 3) 0 ([1] 2.\nThe current position moves forward by the length plus the skip size, a total of 5, causing it not to move because it wraps around: 4 3 0 [1] 2. The skip size increases to 2.\nThe third length, 1, selects a sublist of a single element, and so reversing it has no effect.\nThe current position moves forward by the length (1) plus the skip size (2): 4 [3] 0 1 2. The skip size increases to 3.\nThe fourth length, 5, selects every element starting with the second: 4) ([3] 0 1 2. Reversing this sublist (3 0 1 2 4 into 4 2 1 0 3) produces: 3) ([4] 2 1 0.\nFinally, the current position moves forward by 8: 3 4 2 1 [0]. The skip size increases to 4.\nIn this example, the first two numbers in the list end up being 3 and 4; to check the process, you can multiply them together to produce 12.\n\nHowever, you should instead use the standard list size of 256 (with values 0 to 255) and the sequence of lengths in your puzzle input.

According to the locals, it's not safe to cross the stream at the moment because it's full of garbage. You look down at the stream; rather than water, you discover that it's a stream of characters.\n\nYou sit for a while and record part of the stream (your puzzle input). The characters represent groups - sequences that begin with { and end with }. Within a group, there are zero or more other things, separated by commas: either another group or garbage. Since groups can contain other groups, a } only closes the most-recently-opened unclosed group - that is, they are nestable. Your puzzle input represents a single, large group which itself contains many smaller ones.\n\nSometimes, instead of a group, you will find garbage. Garbage begins with < and ends with >.

A recursive algorithm has gotten out of hand, and now they're balanced precariously in a large tower.\n\nOne program at the bottom supports the entire tower. It's holding a large disc, and on the disc are balanced several more sub-towers. At the bottom of these sub-towers, standing on the bottom disc, are other programs, each holding their own disc, and so on. At the very tops of these sub-sub-sub-...-towers, many programs stand simply keeping the disc below them balanced but with no disc of their own.\n\nYou offer to help, but first you need to understand the structure of these towers. You ask each program to yell out their name, their weight, and (if they're holding a disc) the names of the programs immediately above them balancing on that disc. You write this information down (your puzzle input). Unfortunately, in their panic, they don't do this in an orderly fashion; by the time you're done, you're not sure which program gave which information.\n\nFor example, if your list is the following:\n\npbga (66)\nxhth (57)\nebii (61)\nhavc (66)\nktlj (57)\nfwft (72) -> ktlj, cntj, xhth\nqoyq (66)\npadx (45) -> pbga, havc, qoyq\ntknk (41) -> ugml, padx, fwft\njptl (61)\nugml (68) -> gyxo, ebii, jptl\ngyxo (61)\ncntj (57)\n...then you would be able to recreate the structure of the towers that looks like this:\n\n              gyxo\n            /     \n        ugml - ebii\n      /           \n    |         jptl\n    |        \n    |         pbga\n    /        /\ntknk --- padx - havc\n                |         qoyq\n    |             \n    |         ktlj\n            /     \n        fwft - cntj\n                 \n              xhth\nIn this example, tknk is at the bottom of the tower (the bottom program), and is holding up ugml, padx, and fwft. Those programs are, in turn, holding up other programs; in this example, none of those programs are holding up any other programs, and are all the tops of their own towers. (The actual tower balancing in front of you is much larger.)\n\nBefore you're ready to help them, you need to make sure your information is correct.

Jumps are relative: -1 moves to the previous instruction, and 2 skips the next one. Start at the first instruction in the list. The goal is to follow the jumps until one leads outside the list.\n\nIn addition, these instructions are a little strange; after each jump, the offset of that instruction increases by 1. So, if you come across an offset of 3, you would move three instructions forward, but change it to a 4 for the next time it is encountered.\n\nFor example, consider the following list of jump offsets:\n\n0\n3\n0\n1\n-3\nPositive jumps (\"forward\") move downward; negative jumps move upward. For legibility in this example, these offset values will be written all on one line, with the current instruction marked in parentheses. The following steps would be taken before an exit is found:\n\n(0) 3  0  1  -3  - before we have taken any steps.\n(1) 3  0  1  -3  - jump with offset 0 (that is, don't jump at all). Fortunately, the instruction is then incremented to 1.\n2 (3) 0  1  -3  - step forward because of the instruction we just modified. The first instruction is incremented again, now to 2.\n2  4  0  1 (-3) - jump all the way to the end; leave a 4 behind.\n2 (4) 0  1  -2  - go back to where we just were; increment -3 to -2.\n2  5  0  1  -2  - jump 4 steps forward, escaping the maze.\nIn this example, the exit is reached in 5 steps.\n\nHow many steps does it take to reach the exit?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 336905.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow, the jumps are even stranger: after each jump, if the offset was three or more, instead decrease it by 1. Otherwise, increase it by 1 as before.\n\nUsing this rule with the above example, the process now takes 10 steps, and the offset values after finding the exit are left as 2 3 2 3 -1.\n\nHow many steps does it now take to reach the exit?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.file;\nimport std.conv;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    int[] jumps;\n    foreach (line; File(\"input.txt\").byLine())\n    {\n        jumps ~= to!int(line);\n    }\n\n    int currentIndex = 0;\n    int steps = 0;\n\n    while (currentIndex >= 0 && currentIndex < jumps.length)\n    {\n        int offset = jumps[currentIndex];\n        jumps[currentIndex] += offset >= 3 ? -1 : 1;\n        currentIndex += offset;\n        steps++;\n    }\n\n    writeln(steps);\n}\n```\n"}]}

You need to overwrite some disks with random-looking data to cover your tracks and update the local security system with a new checksum for those disks.\n\nFor the data to not be suspicious, it needs to have certain properties; purely random data will be detected as tampering. To generate appropriate random data, you'll need to use a modified dragon curve.\n\nStart with an appropriate initial state (your puzzle input).

The sculpture is in a sealed enclosure and seems to involve a set of identical spherical capsules that are carried to the top and allowed to bounce through the maze of spinning pieces.\n\nPart of the sculpture is even interactive! When a button is pressed, a capsule is dropped and tries to fall through slots in a set of rotating discs to finally go through a little hole at the bottom and come out of the sculpture. If any of the slots aren't aligned with the capsule as it passes, the capsule bounces off the disc and soars away. You feel compelled to get one of those capsules.\n\nThe discs pause their motion each second and come in different sizes; they seem to each have a fixed number of positions at which they stop. You decide to call the position with the slot 0, and count up for each position it reaches next.\n\nFurthermore, the discs are spaced out so that after you push the button, one second elapses before the first disc is reached, and one second elapses as the capsule passes from one disc to the one below it. So, if you push the button at time=100, then the capsule reaches the top disc at time=101, the second disc at time=102, the third disc at time=103, and so on.\n\nThe button will only drop a capsule at an integer time - no fractional seconds allowed.\n\nFor example, at time=0, suppose you see the following arrangement:\n\nDisc #1 has 5 positions; at time=0, it is at position 4.\nDisc #2 has 2 positions; at time=0, it is at position 1.\nIf you press the button exactly at time=0, the capsule would start to fall; it would reach the first disc at time=1. Since the first disc was at position 4 at time=0, by time=1 it has ticked one position forward. As a five-position disc, the next position is 0, and the capsule falls through the slot.\n\nThen, at time=2, the capsule reaches the second disc. The second disc has ticked forward two positions at this point: it started at position 1, then continued to position 0, and finally ended up at position 1 again. Because there's only a slot at position 0, the capsule bounces away.\n\nIf, however, you wait until time=5 to push the button, then when the capsule reaches each disc, the first disc will have ticked forward 5+1 = 6 times (to position 0), and the second disc will have ticked forward 5+2 = 7 times (also to position 0). In this case, the capsule would fall through the discs and come out of the machine.\n\nHowever, your situation has more than two discs; you've noted their positions in your puzzle input.

Instead, please memorize and follow the procedure below to access the bathrooms.\"\n\nThe document goes on to explain that each button to be pressed can be found by starting on the previous button and moving to adjacent buttons on the keypad: U moves up, D moves down, L moves left, and R moves right. Each line of instructions corresponds to one button, starting at the previous button (or, for the first line, the \"5\" button); press whatever button you're on at the end of each line. If a move doesn't lead to a button, ignore it.\n\nYou can't hold it much longer, so you decide to figure out the code as you walk to the bathroom.

What is the bathroom code?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 12578.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nYou finally arrive at the bathroom (it's a several minute walk from the lobby so visitors can behold the many fancy conference rooms and water coolers on this floor) and go to punch in the code.

It comes with instructions and an example program, but the computer itself seems to be malfunctioning. She's curious what the program does, and would like you to help her run it.\n\nThe manual explains that the computer supports two registers and six instructions (truly, it goes on to remind the reader, a state-of-the-art technology). The registers are named a and b, can hold any non-negative integer, and begin with a value of 0. The instructions are as follows:\n\nhlf r sets register r to half its current value, then continues with the next instruction.\ntpl r sets register r to triple its current value, then continues with the next instruction.\ninc r increments register r, adding 1 to it, then continues with the next instruction.\njmp offset is a jump; it continues with the instruction offset away relative to itself.\njie r, offset is like jmp, but only jumps if register r is even (\"jump if even\").\njio r, offset is like jmp, but only jumps if register r is 1 (\"jump if one\", not odd).\nAll three jump instructions work with an offset relative to that instruction. The offset is always written with a prefix + or - to indicate the direction of the jump (forward or backward, respectively). For example, jmp +1 would simply continue with the next instruction, while jmp +0 would continuously jump back to itself forever.\n\nThe program exits when it tries to run an instruction beyond the ones defined.\n\nFor example, this program sets a to 2, because the jio instruction causes it to skip the tpl instruction:\n\ninc a\njio a, +2\ntpl a\ninc a\nWhat is the value in register b when the program in your puzzle input is finished executing?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.file;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.array; // Added import for std.array\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    string data = cast(string) read(\"input.txt\");\n    string[] instructions = data.split(\"\\n\");\n\n    int[string] registers = [\"a\": 0, \"b\": 0];\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < instructions.length; i++)\n    {\n        string[] parts = instructions[i].split(\" \");\n\n        switch (parts[0])\n        {\n            case \"hlf\":\n                registers[parts[1]] /= 2;\n                break;\n            case \"tpl\":\n                registers[parts[1]] *= 3;\n                break;\n            case \"inc\":\n                registers[parts[1]]++;\n                break;\n            case \"jmp\":\n                int offset = to!int(parts[1]);\n                i += offset - 1;\n                break;\n            case \"jie\":\n                if (registers[parts[1][0..$-1]] % 2 == 0)\n                {\n                    int offset = to!int(parts[2]);\n                    i += offset - 1;\n                }\n                break;\n            case \"jio\":\n                if (registers[parts[1][0..$-1]] == 1)\n                {\n                    int offset = to!int(parts[2]);\n                    i += offset - 1;\n                }\n                break;\n            default:\n                writeln(\"Unknown instruction: \", parts[0]);\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    writeln(registers[\"b\"]);\n}\n```\n"}]}

It's an RPG, and he's stuck on a boss. He needs to know what equipment to buy at the shop. He hands you the controller.\n\nIn this game, the player (you) and the enemy (the boss) take turns attacking. The player always goes first. Each attack reduces the opponent's hit points by at least 1. The first character at or below 0 hit points loses.\n\nDamage dealt by an attacker each turn is equal to the attacker's damage score minus the defender's armor score. An attacker always does at least 1 damage. So, if the attacker has a damage score of 8, and the defender has an armor score of 3, the defender loses 5 hit points. If the defender had an armor score of 300, the defender would still lose 1 hit point.\n\nYour damage score and armor score both start at zero. They can be increased by buying items in exchange for gold. You start with no items and have as much gold as you need. Your total damage or armor is equal to the sum of those stats from all of your items. You have 100 hit points.\n\nHere is what the item shop is selling:\n\nWeapons:    Cost  Damage  Armor\nDagger        8     4       0\nShortsword   10     5       0\nWarhammer    25     6       0\nLongsword    40     7       0\nGreataxe     74     8       0\n\nArmor:      Cost  Damage  Armor\nLeather      13     0       1\nChainmail    31     0       2\nSplintmail   53     0       3\nBandedmail   75     0       4\nPlatemail   102     0       5\n\nRings:      Cost  Damage  Armor\nDamage +1    25     1       0\nDamage +2    50     2       0\nDamage +3   100     3       0\nDefense +1   20     0       1\nDefense +2   40     0       2\nDefense +3   80     0       3\nYou must buy exactly one weapon; no dual-wielding. Armor is optional, but you can't use more than one. You can buy 0-2 rings (at most one for each hand). You must use any items you buy. The shop only has one of each item, so you can't buy, for example, two rings of Damage +3.\n\nFor example, suppose you have 8 hit points, 5 damage, and 5 armor, and that the boss has 12 hit points, 7 damage, and 2 armor:\n\nThe player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 9 hit points.\nThe boss deals 7-5 = 2 damage; the player goes down to 6 hit points.\nThe player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 6 hit points.\nThe boss deals 7-5 = 2 damage; the player goes down to 4 hit points.\nThe player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 3 hit points.\nThe boss deals 7-5 = 2 damage; the player goes down to 2 hit points.\nThe player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 0 hit points.\nIn this scenario, the player wins!

The total score would go down, though: only 57600000, the best you can do in such trying circumstances.\n\nGiven the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make with a calorie total of 500?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.algorithm;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.string;\nimport std.file;\n\nstruct Ingredient {\n    string name;\n    int capacity;\n    int durability;\n    int flavor;\n    int texture;\n    int calories;\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n    auto lines = readText(\"input.txt\").splitter(\"\\n\").array;\n    Ingredient[] ingredients;\n    foreach (line; lines) {\n        auto parts = line.split(\": \").array;\n        auto name = parts[0];\n        auto props = parts[1].split(\", \").array;\n        auto capacity = props[0].split(\" \")[1].to!int;\n        auto durability = props[1].split(\" \")[1].to!int;\n        auto flavor = props[2].split(\" \")[1].to!int;\n        auto texture = props[3].split(\" \")[1].to!int;\n        auto calories = props[4].split(\" \")[1].to!int;\n        ingredients ~= Ingredient(name, capacity, durability, flavor, texture, calories);\n    }\n\n    int maxScore = 0;\n    int maxScore500Cal = 0;\n\n    foreach (i; 0 .. 101) {\n        foreach (j; 0 .. 101 - i) {\n            foreach (k; 0 .. 101 - i - j) {\n                int l = 100 - i - j - k;\n                int capacity = max(0, i * ingredients[0].capacity + j * ingredients[1].capacity + k * ingredients[2].capacity + l * ingredients[3].capacity);\n                int durability = max(0, i * ingredients[0].durability + j * ingredients[1].durability + k * ingredients[2].durability + l * ingredients[3].durability);\n                int flavor = max(0, i * ingredients[0].flavor + j * ingredients[1].flavor + k * ingredients[2].flavor + l * ingredients[3].flavor);\n                int texture = max(0, i * ingredients[0].texture + j * ingredients[1].texture + k * ingredients[2].texture + l * ingredients[3].texture);\n                int calories = i * ingredients[0].calories + j * ingredients[1].calories + k * ingredients[2].calories + l * ingredients[3].calories;\n\n                int score = capacity * durability * flavor * texture;\n                if (score > maxScore) {\n                    maxScore = score;\n                }\n\n                if (calories == 500 && score > maxScore500Cal) {\n                    maxScore500Cal = score;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    writeln(\"Part One: \", maxScore);\n    writeln(\"Part Two: \", maxScore500Cal);\n}\n```\n"}]}

All you have to do is find the right balance of ingredients.\n\nYour recipe leaves room for exactly 100 teaspoons of ingredients. You make a list of the remaining ingredients you could use to finish the recipe (your puzzle input) and their properties per teaspoon:\n\ncapacity (how well it helps the cookie absorb milk)\ndurability (how well it keeps the cookie intact when full of milk)\nflavor (how tasty it makes the cookie)\ntexture (how it improves the feel of the cookie)\ncalories (how many calories it adds to the cookie)\nYou can only measure ingredients in whole-teaspoon amounts accurately, and you have to be accurate so you can reproduce your results in the future. The total score of a cookie can be found by adding up each of the properties (negative totals become 0) and then multiplying together everything except calories.\n\nFor instance, suppose you have these two ingredients:\n\nButterscotch: capacity -1, durability -2, flavor 6, texture 3, calories 8\nCinnamon: capacity 2, durability 3, flavor -2, texture -1, calories 3\nThen, choosing to use 44 teaspoons of butterscotch and 56 teaspoons of cinnamon (because the amounts of each ingredient must add up to 100) would result in a cookie with the following properties:\n\nA capacity of 44*-1 + 56*2 = 68\nA durability of 44*-2 + 56*3 = 80\nA flavor of 44*6 + 56*-2 = 152\nA texture of 44*3 + 56*-1 = 76\nMultiplying these together (68 * 80 * 152 * 76, ignoring calories for now) results in a total score of 62842880, which happens to be the best score possible given these ingredients. If any properties had produced a negative total, it would have instead become zero, causing the whole score to multiply to zero.\n\nGiven the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```d\nimport std.stdio;\nimport std.file;\nimport std.conv;\nimport std.array;\nimport std.algorithm;\n\nstruct Ingredient {\n\tstring name;\n\tint capacity;\n\tint durability;\n\tint flavor;\n\tint texture;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n\tauto ingredients = readIngredients(\"input.txt\");\n\tint maxScore = findMaxScore(ingredients, 100);\n\twriteln(maxScore);\n\treturn 0;\n}\n\nIngredient[] readIngredients(string filename)\n{\n\tauto file = File(filename, \"r\");\n\tstring line;\n\tIngredient[] ingredients;\n\n\twhile ((line = file.readln()).length > 0)\n\t{\n\t\tauto parts = line.split;\n\t\tif (parts.length < 11)\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\n\t\tint capacity = to!int(parts[2][0 .. $-1]);\n\t\tint durability = to!int(parts[4][0 .. $-1]);\n\t\tint flavor = to!int(parts[6][0 .. $-1]);\n\t\tint texture = to!int(parts[8][0 .. $-1]);\n\n\t\tingredients ~= Ingredient(parts[0], capacity, durability, flavor, texture);\n\t}\n\n\treturn ingredients;\n}\n\nint findMaxScore(Ingredient[] ingredients, int totalTeaspoons)\n{\n\treturn calculateMaxScore(ingredients, 0, totalTeaspoons, []);\n}\n\nint calculateMaxScore(Ingredient[] ingredients, int index, int remaining, int[] teaspoons)\n{\n\tif (index == ingredients.length - 1)\n\t{\n\t\tteaspoons ~= remaining;\n\t\treturn score(ingredients, teaspoons);\n\t}\n\n\tint maxScore = 0;\n\tforeach (i; 0 .. remaining + 1)\n\t{\n\t\tauto score = calculateMaxScore(ingredients, index + 1, remaining - i, teaspoons ~ i);\n\t\tif (score > maxScore)\n\t\t\tmaxScore = score;\n\t}\n\treturn maxScore;\n}\n\nint score(Ingredient[] ingredients, int[] teaspoons)\n{\n\tint capacity = 0;\n\tint durability = 0;\n\tint flavor = 0;\n\tint texture = 0;\n\n\tforeach (i, ingredient; ingredients)\n\t{\n\t\tcapacity += ingredient.capacity * teaspoons[i];\n\t\tdurability += ingredient.durability * teaspoons[i];\n\t\tflavor += ingredient.flavor * teaspoons[i];\n\t\ttexture += ingredient.texture * teaspoons[i];\n\t}\n\n\tif (capacity < 0) capacity = 0;\n\tif (durability < 0) durability = 0;\n\tif (flavor < 0) flavor = 0;\n\tif (texture < 0) texture = 0;\n\n\treturn capacity * durability * flavor * texture;\n}\n```\n"}]}

Reindeer can fly at high speeds, but must rest occasionally to recover their energy. Santa would like to know which of his reindeer is fastest, and so he has them race.\n\nReindeer can only either be flying (always at their top speed) or resting (not moving at all), and always spend whole seconds in either state.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following Reindeer:\n\nComet can fly 14 km/s for 10 seconds, but then must rest for 127 seconds.\nDancer can fly 16 km/s for 11 seconds, but then must rest for 162 seconds.\nAfter one second, Comet has gone 14 km, while Dancer has gone 16 km. After ten seconds, Comet has gone 140 km, while Dancer has gone 160 km. On the eleventh second, Comet begins resting (staying at 140 km), and Dancer continues on for a total distance of 176 km. On the 12th second, both reindeer are resting. They continue to rest until the 138th second, when Comet flies for another ten seconds. On the 174th second, Dancer flies for another 11 seconds.\n\nIn this example, after the 1000th second, both reindeer are resting, and Comet is in the lead at 1120 km (poor Dancer has only gotten 1056 km by that point). So, in this situation, Comet would win (if the race ended at 1000 seconds).\n\nGiven the descriptions of each reindeer (in your puzzle input), after exactly 2503 seconds, what distance has the winning reindeer traveled?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 2696.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nSeeing how reindeer move in bursts, Santa decides he's not pleased with the old scoring system.\n\nInstead, at the end of each second, he awards one point to the reindeer currently in the lead. (If there are multiple reindeer tied for the lead, they each get one point.) He keeps the traditional 2503 second time limit, of course, as doing otherwise would be entirely ridiculous.\n\nGiven the example reindeer from above, after the first second, Dancer is in the lead and gets one point. He stays in the lead until several seconds into Comet's second burst: after the 140th second, Comet pulls into the lead and gets his first point. Of course, since Dancer had been in the lead for the 139 seconds before that, he has accumulated 139 points by the 140th second.\n\nAfter the 1000th second, Dancer has accumulated 689 points, while poor Comet, our old champion, only has 312.
