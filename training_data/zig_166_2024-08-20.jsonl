Instead of forming snow, the water that's been absorbed into the air seems to be forming hail!\n\nMaybe there's something you can do to break up the hailstones?\n\nDue to strong, probably-magical winds, the hailstones are all flying through the air in perfectly linear trajectories. You make a note of each hailstone's position and velocity (your puzzle input). For example:\n\n19, 13, 30 @ -2,  1, -2\n18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2\n20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4\n12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1\n20, 19, 15 @  1, -5, -3\nEach line of text corresponds to the position and velocity of a single hailstone. The positions indicate where the hailstones are right now (at time 0). The velocities are constant and indicate exactly how far each hailstone will move in one nanosecond.\n\nEach line of text uses the format px py pz @ vx vy vz. For instance, the hailstone specified by 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3 has initial X position 20, Y position 19, Z position 15, X velocity 1, Y velocity -5, and Z velocity -3. After one nanosecond, the hailstone would be at 21, 14, 12.\n\nPerhaps you won't have to do anything. How likely are the hailstones to collide with each other and smash into tiny ice crystals?\n\nTo estimate this, consider only the X and Y axes; ignore the Z axis. Looking forward in time, how many of the hailstones' paths will intersect within a test area? (The hailstones themselves don't have to collide, just test for intersections between the paths they will trace.)\n\nIn this example, look for intersections that happen with an X and Y position each at least 7 and at most 27; in your actual data, you'll need to check a much larger test area. Comparing all pairs of hailstones' future paths produces the following results:\n\nHailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2\nHailstone B: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2\nHailstones' paths will cross inside the test area (at x=14.333, y=15.333).\n\nHailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2\nHailstone B: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4\nHailstones' paths will cross inside the test area (at x=11.667, y=16.667).\n\nHailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2\nHailstone B: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1\nHailstones' paths will cross outside the test area (at x=6.2, y=19.4).\n\nHailstone A: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2\nHailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3\nHailstones' paths crossed in the past for hailstone A.\n\nHailstone A: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2\nHailstone B: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4\nHailstones' paths are parallel; they never intersect.\n\nHailstone A: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2\nHailstone B: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1\nHailstones' paths will cross outside the test area (at x=-6, y=-5).\n\nHailstone A: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2\nHailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3\nHailstones' paths crossed in the past for both hailstones.\n\nHailstone A: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4\nHailstone B: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1\nHailstones' paths will cross outside the test area (at x=-2, y=3).\n\nHailstone A: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4\nHailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3\nHailstones' paths crossed in the past for hailstone B.\n\nHailstone A: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1\nHailstone B: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3\nHailstones' paths crossed in the past for both hailstones.\nSo, in this example, 2 hailstones' future paths cross inside the boundaries of the test area.\n\nHowever, you'll need to search a much larger test area if you want to see if any hailstones might collide. Look for intersections that happen with an X and Y position each at least 200000000000000 and at most 400000000000000. Disregard the Z axis entirely.\n\nConsidering only the X and Y axes, check all pairs of hailstones' future paths for intersections. How many of these intersections occur within the test area?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nconst Coord = struct {\n    x: f64,\n    y: f64,\n    z: f64,\n};\n\nconst Point = struct {\n    pos: Coord,\n    vel: Coord,\n};\n\nfn parseInput(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, input: []const u8) ![]Point {\n    var points = std.ArrayList(Point).init(allocator);\n    defer points.deinit();\n\n    var lines = std.mem.split(u8, input, \"\\n\");\n    while (lines.next()) |line| {\n        var point: Point = undefined;\n        var parts = std.mem.split(u8, line, \"@\");\n        var pos_parts = std.mem.split(u8, parts.next().?, \",\");\n        var vel_parts = std.mem.split(u8, parts.next().?, \",\");\n\n        point.pos.x = try std.fmt.parseFloat(f64, std.mem.trim(u8, pos_parts.next().?, \" \"));\n        point.pos.y = try std.fmt.parseFloat(f64, std.mem.trim(u8, pos_parts.next().?, \" \"));\n        point.pos.z = try std.fmt.parseFloat(f64, std.mem.trim(u8, pos_parts.next().?, \" \"));\n        point.vel.x = try std.fmt.parseFloat(f64, std.mem.trim(u8, vel_parts.next().?, \" \"));\n        point.vel.y = try std.fmt.parseFloat(f64, std.mem.trim(u8, vel_parts.next().?, \" \"));\n        point.vel.z = try std.fmt.parseFloat(f64, std.mem.trim(u8, vel_parts.next().?, \" \"));\n\n        try points.append(point);\n    }\n\n    return points.toOwnedSlice();\n}\n\nfn isIntersecting2D(p1: Point, p2: Point, min: f64, max: f64) bool {\n    const det = p1.vel.x * p2.vel.y - p2.vel.x * p1.vel.y;\n    if (det == 0) return false;\n\n    const t1 = (p2.vel.y * (p2.pos.x - p1.pos.x) - p2.vel.x * (p2.pos.y - p1.pos.y)) / det;\n    const t2 = (p1.vel.y * (p2.pos.x - p1.pos.x) - p1.vel.x * (p2.pos.y - p1.pos.y)) / det;\n\n    if (t1 < 0 or t2 < 0) return false;\n\n    const x = p1.pos.x + p1.vel.x * t1;\n    const y = p1.pos.y + p1.vel.y * t1;\n\n    return x >= min and x <= max and y >= min and y <= max;\n}\n\nfn solve(points: []const Point, min: f64, max: f64) usize {\n    var cnt: usize = 0;\n    for (points[0..points.len-1], 0..) |p1, i| {\n        for (points[i+1..]) |p2| {\n            if (isIntersecting2D(p1, p2, min, max)) {\n                cnt += 1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return cnt;\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);\n    defer arena.deinit();\n    const allocator = arena.allocator();\n\n    const input = try std.fs.cwd().readFileAlloc(allocator, \"input.txt\", 1024 * 1024);\n    defer allocator.free(input);\n\n    const points = try parseInput(allocator, input);\n    defer allocator.free(points);\n\n    const result = solve(points, 200000000000000, 400000000000000);\n    try std.io.getStdOut().writer().print(\"{}\\n\", .{result});\n}\n```\n"}]}

However, to catch up with the large backlog of parts requests, the factory will also need a large supply of lava for a while; the Elves have already started creating a large lagoon nearby for this purpose.\n\nHowever, they aren't sure the lagoon will be big enough; they've asked you to take a look at the dig plan (your puzzle input). For example:\n\nR 6 (#70c710)\nD 5 (#0dc571)\nL 2 (#5713f0)\nD 2 (#d2c081)\nR 2 (#59c680)\nD 2 (#411b91)\nL 5 (#8ceee2)\nU 2 (#caa173)\nL 1 (#1b58a2)\nU 2 (#caa171)\nR 2 (#7807d2)\nU 3 (#a77fa3)\nL 2 (#015232)\nU 2 (#7a21e3)\nThe digger starts in a 1 meter cube hole in the ground. They then dig the specified number of meters up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), clearing full 1 meter cubes as they go. The directions are given as seen from above, so if \"up\" were north, then \"right\" would be east, and so on. Each trench is also listed with the color that the edge of the trench should be painted as an RGB hexadecimal color code.\n\nWhen viewed from above, the above example dig plan would result in the following loop of trench (#) having been dug out from otherwise ground-level terrain (.):\n\n#######\n#.....#\n###...#\n..#...#\n..#...#\n###.###\n#...#..\n##..###\n.#....#\n.######\nAt this point, the trench could contain 38 cubic meters of lava. However, this is just the edge of the lagoon; the next step is to dig out the interior so that it is one meter deep as well:\n\n#######\n#######\n#######\n..#####\n..#####\n#######\n#####..\n#######\n.######\n.######\nNow, the lagoon can contain a much more respectable 62 cubic meters of lava. While the interior is dug out, the edges are also painted according to the color codes in the dig plan.\n\nThe Elves are concerned the lagoon won't be large enough; if they follow their dig plan, how many cubic meters of lava could it hold?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 58550.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe Elves were right to be concerned; the planned lagoon would be much too small.\n\nAfter a few minutes, someone realizes what happened; someone swapped the color and instruction parameters when producing the dig plan. They don't have time to fix the bug; one of them asks if you can extract the correct instructions from the hexadecimal codes.\n\nEach hexadecimal code is six hexadecimal digits long. The first five hexadecimal digits encode the distance in meters as a five-digit hexadecimal number. The last hexadecimal digit encodes the direction to dig: 0 means R, 1 means D, 2 means L, and 3 means U.\n\nSo, in the above example, the hexadecimal codes can be converted into the true instructions:\n\n#70c710 = R 461937\n#0dc571 = D 56407\n#5713f0 = R 356671\n#d2c081 = D 863240\n#59c680 = R 367720\n#411b91 = D 266681\n#8ceee2 = L 577262\n#caa173 = U 829975\n#1b58a2 = L 112010\n#caa171 = D 829975\n#7807d2 = L 491645\n#a77fa3 = U 686074\n#015232 = L 5411\n#7a21e3 = U 500254\nDigging out this loop and its interior produces a lagoon that can hold an impressive 952408144115 cubic meters of lava.\n\nConvert the hexadecimal color codes into the correct instructions; if the Elves follow this new dig plan, how many cubic meters of lava could the lagoon hold?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nconst Coord = struct {\n    x: i64,\n    y: i64,\n\n    fn add(self: Coord, other: Coord) Coord {\n        return .{ .x = self.x + other.x, .y = self.y + other.y };\n    }\n\n    fn multiplyByScalar(self: Coord, s: i64) Coord {\n        return .{ .x = self.x * s, .y = self.y * s };\n    }\n};\n\nconst North = Coord{ .x = 0, .y = -1 };\nconst West = Coord{ .x = -1, .y = 0 };\nconst South = Coord{ .x = 0, .y = 1 };\nconst East = Coord{ .x = 1, .y = 0 };\n\nfn abs(x: i64) i64 {\n    return if (x < 0) -x else x;\n}\n\nfn parseInput(input: []const u8, allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !std.ArrayList(Coord) {\n    var vertices = std.ArrayList(Coord).init(allocator);\n    var current = Coord{ .x = 0, .y = 0 };\n    try vertices.append(current);\n\n    var lines = std.mem.split(u8, input, \"\\n\");\n    while (lines.next()) |line| {\n        const color = line[line.len - 7 .. line.len - 1];\n        const dir_input = color[5];\n        const length = try std.fmt.parseInt(i64, color[0..5], 16);\n\n        const dir = switch (dir_input) {\n            '3' => North,\n            '2' => West,\n            '1' => South,\n            '0' => East,\n            else => unreachable,\n        };\n\n        current = current.add(dir.multiplyByScalar(length));\n        try vertices.append(current);\n    }\n\n    return vertices;\n}\n\nfn shoelace(vertices: []const Coord) i64 {\n    var area: i64 = 0;\n    const n = vertices.len;\n\n    for (vertices, 0..) |v, i| {\n        const next = vertices[(i + 1) % n];\n        area += v.x * next.y;\n        area -= v.y * next.x;\n    }\n\n    return @divExact(abs(area), 2);\n}\n\nfn perimeter(vertices: []const Coord) i64 {\n    var perim: i64 = 0;\n    const n = vertices.len;\n\n    for (vertices, 0..) |v, i| {\n        const next = vertices[(i + 1) % n];\n        perim += abs(v.x - next.x) + abs(v.y - next.y);\n    }\n\n    return perim;\n}\n\nfn calculatePolygonArea(vertices: []const Coord) i64 {\n    return shoelace(vertices) + @divExact(perimeter(vertices), 2) + 1;\n}\n\nfn solve(input: []const u8, allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !i64 {\n    var vertices = try parseInput(input, allocator);\n    defer vertices.deinit();\n\n    return calculatePolygonArea(vertices.items);\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const input = try std.fs.cwd().readFileAlloc(allocator, \"input.txt\", 1024 * 1024);\n    defer allocator.free(input);\n\n    const result = try solve(input, allocator);\n    try std.io.getStdOut().writer().print(\"{d}\\n\", .{result});\n}\n```\n"}]}

As you approach the mountain, you find that the light is being collected by the wall of a large facility embedded in the mountainside.\n\nYou find a door under a large sign that says \"Lava Production Facility\" and next to a smaller sign that says \"Danger - Personal Protective Equipment required beyond this point\".\n\nAs you step inside, you are immediately greeted by a somewhat panicked reindeer wearing goggles and a loose-fitting hard hat. The reindeer leads you to a shelf of goggles and hard hats (you quickly find some that fit) and then further into the facility. At one point, you pass a button with a faint snout mark and the label \"PUSH FOR HELP\". No wonder you were loaded into that trebuchet so quickly!\n\nYou pass through a final set of doors surrounded with even more warning signs and into what must be the room that collects all of the light from outside. As you admire the large assortment of lenses available to further focus the light, the reindeer brings you a book titled \"Initialization Manual\".\n\n\"Hello!\", the book cheerfully begins, apparently unaware of the concerned reindeer reading over your shoulder. \"This procedure will let you bring the Lava Production Facility online - all without burning or melting anything unintended!\"\n\n\"Before you begin, please be prepared to use the Holiday ASCII String Helper algorithm (appendix 1A).\" You turn to appendix 1A. The reindeer leans closer with interest.\n\nThe HASH algorithm is a way to turn any string of characters into a single number in the range 0 to 255. To run the HASH algorithm on a string, start with a current value of 0. Then, for each character in the string starting from the beginning:\n\nDetermine the ASCII code for the current character of the string.\nIncrease the current value by the ASCII code you just determined.\nSet the current value to itself multiplied by 17.\nSet the current value to the remainder of dividing itself by 256.\nAfter following these steps for each character in the string in order, the current value is the output of the HASH algorithm.\n\nSo, to find the result of running the HASH algorithm on the string HASH:\n\nThe current value starts at 0.\nThe first character is H; its ASCII code is 72.\nThe current value increases to 72.\nThe current value is multiplied by 17 to become 1224.\nThe current value becomes 200 (the remainder of 1224 divided by 256).\nThe next character is A; its ASCII code is 65.\nThe current value increases to 265.\nThe current value is multiplied by 17 to become 4505.\nThe current value becomes 153 (the remainder of 4505 divided by 256).\nThe next character is S; its ASCII code is 83.\nThe current value increases to 236.\nThe current value is multiplied by 17 to become 4012.\nThe current value becomes 172 (the remainder of 4012 divided by 256).\nThe next character is H; its ASCII code is 72.\nThe current value increases to 244.\nThe current value is multiplied by 17 to become 4148.\nThe current value becomes 52 (the remainder of 4148 divided by 256).\nSo, the result of running the HASH algorithm on the string HASH is 52.\n\nThe initialization sequence (your puzzle input) is a comma-separated list of steps to start the Lava Production Facility. Ignore newline characters when parsing the initialization sequence. To verify that your HASH algorithm is working, the book offers the sum of the result of running the HASH algorithm on each step in the initialization sequence.\n\nFor example:\n\nrn=1,cm-,qp=3,cm=2,qp-,pc=4,ot=9,ab=5,pc-,pc=6,ot=7\nThis initialization sequence specifies 11 individual steps; the result of running the HASH algorithm on each of the steps is as follows:\n\nrn=1 becomes 30.\ncm- becomes 253.\nqp=3 becomes 97.\ncm=2 becomes 47.\nqp- becomes 14.\npc=4 becomes 180.\not=9 becomes 9.\nab=5 becomes 197.\npc- becomes 48.\npc=6 becomes 214.\not=7 becomes 231.\nIn this example, the sum of these results is 1320. Unfortunately, the reindeer has stolen the page containing the expected verification number and is currently running around the facility with it excitedly.\n\nRun the HASH algorithm on each step in the initialization sequence. What is the sum of the results?

However, there's a catch: the universe expanded in the time it took the light from those galaxies to reach the observatory.\n\nDue to something involving gravitational effects, only some space expands. In fact, the result is that any rows or columns that contain no galaxies should all actually be twice as big.\n\nIn the above example, three columns and two rows contain no galaxies:\n\n   v  v  v\n ...#......\n .......#..\n #.........\n>..........<\n ......#...\n .#........\n .........#\n>..........<\n .......#..\n #...#.....\n   ^  ^  ^\nThese rows and columns need to be twice as big; the result of cosmic expansion therefore looks like this:\n\n....#........\n.........#...\n#............\n.............\n.............\n........#....\n.#...........\n............#\n.............\n.............\n.........#...\n#....#.......\nEquipped with this expanded universe, the shortest path between every pair of galaxies can be found.

For each pair, find any shortest path between the two galaxies using only steps that move up, down, left, or right exactly one . or # at a time.

After asking around, you discover that there is indeed normally a large pile of sand somewhere near here, but you don't see anything besides lots of water and the small island where the ferry has docked.\n\nAs you try to figure out what to do next, you notice a poster on a wall near the ferry dock. \"Boat races! Open to the public! Grand prize is an all-expenses-paid trip to Desert Island!\" That must be where the sand comes from! Best of all, the boat races are starting in just a few minutes.\n\nYou manage to sign up as a competitor in the boat races just in time. The organizer explains that it's not really a traditional race - instead, you will get a fixed amount of time during which your boat has to travel as far as it can, and you win if your boat goes the farthest.\n\nAs part of signing up, you get a sheet of paper (your puzzle input) that lists the time allowed for each race and also the best distance ever recorded in that race. To guarantee you win the grand prize, you need to make sure you go farther in each race than the current record holder.\n\nThe organizer brings you over to the area where the boat races are held. The boats are much smaller than you expected - they're actually toy boats, each with a big button on top. Holding down the button charges the boat, and releasing the button allows the boat to move. Boats move faster if their button was held longer, but time spent holding the button counts against the total race time. You can only hold the button at the start of the race, and boats don't move until the button is released.\n\nFor example:\n\nTime:      7  15   30\nDistance:  9  40  200\nThis document describes three races:\n\nThe first race lasts 7 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 9 millimeters.\nThe second race lasts 15 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 40 millimeters.\nThe third race lasts 30 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 200 millimeters.\nYour toy boat has a starting speed of zero millimeters per millisecond. For each whole millisecond you spend at the beginning of the race holding down the button, the boat's speed increases by one millimeter per millisecond.\n\nSo, because the first race lasts 7 milliseconds, you only have a few options:\n\nDon't hold the button at all (that is, hold it for 0 milliseconds) at the start of the race. The boat won't move; it will have traveled 0 millimeters by the end of the race.\nHold the button for 1 millisecond at the start of the race. Then, the boat will travel at a speed of 1 millimeter per millisecond for 6 milliseconds, reaching a total distance traveled of 6 millimeters.\nHold the button for 2 milliseconds, giving the boat a speed of 2 millimeters per millisecond. It will then get 5 milliseconds to move, reaching a total distance of 10 millimeters.\nHold the button for 3 milliseconds. After its remaining 4 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone 12 millimeters.\nHold the button for 4 milliseconds. After its remaining 3 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone 12 millimeters.\nHold the button for 5 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 10 millimeters.\nHold the button for 6 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 6 millimeters.\nHold the button for 7 milliseconds. That's the entire duration of the race. You never let go of the button. The boat can't move until you let go of the button. Please make sure you let go of the button so the boat gets to move. 0 millimeters.\nSince the current record for this race is 9 millimeters, there are actually 4 different ways you could win: you could hold the button for 2, 3, 4, or 5 milliseconds at the start of the race.\n\nIn the second race, you could hold the button for at least 4 milliseconds and at most 11 milliseconds and beat the record, a total of 8 different ways to win.\n\nIn the third race, you could hold the button for at least 11 milliseconds and no more than 19 milliseconds and still beat the record, a total of 9 ways you could win.\n\nTo see how much margin of error you have, determine the number of ways you can beat the record in each race; in this example, if you multiply these values together, you get 288 (4 * 8 * 9).\n\nDetermine the number of ways you could beat the record in each race. What do you get if you multiply these numbers together?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 74698.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nAs the race is about to start, you realize the piece of paper with race times and record distances you got earlier actually just has very bad kerning. There's really only one race - ignore the spaces between the numbers on each line.\n\nSo, the example from before:\n\nTime:      7  15   30\nDistance:  9  40  200\n...now instead means this:\n\nTime:      71530\nDistance:  940200\nNow, you have to figure out how many ways there are to win this single race. In this example, the race lasts for 71530 milliseconds and the record distance you need to beat is 940200 millimeters. You could hold the button anywhere from 14 to 71516 milliseconds and beat the record, a total of 71503 ways!\n\nHow many ways can you beat the record in this one much longer race?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nfn calculateWaysToWinLongRace(time: u64, record: u64) u64 {\n    var low: u64 = 1;\n    var high: u64 = time / 2;\n    var waysToWin: u64 = 0;\n\n    while (low <= high) {\n        const mid = (low + high) / 2;\n        const distance = mid * (time - mid);\n\n        if (distance > record) {\n            waysToWin = time - 2 * mid + 1;\n            high = mid - 1;\n        } else {\n            low = mid + 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return waysToWin;\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var buf_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n\n    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    var time: u64 = 0;\n    var distance: u64 = 0;\n\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |line| {\n        if (line.len == 0) continue;\n        var parts = std.mem.split(u8, line, \":\");\n        _ = parts.next();\n        const value = parts.next().?;\n        var num_str = std.mem.trim(u8, value, \" \");\n        var num: u64 = 0;\n        for (num_str) |c| {\n            if (c >= '0' and c <= '9') {\n                num = num * 10 + (c - '0');\n            }\n        }\n        if (time == 0) {\n            time = num;\n        } else {\n            distance = num;\n        }\n    }\n\n    const waysToWin = calculateWaysToWinLongRace(time, distance);\n\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{waysToWin});\n}\n```\n"}]}

Picking one up, it looks like each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have. You organize the information into a table (your puzzle input).\n\nAs far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles the point value of that card.\n\nFor example:\n\nCard 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53\nCard 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19\nCard 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1\nCard 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83\nCard 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36\nCard 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11\nIn the above example, card 1 has five winning numbers (41, 48, 83, 86, and 17) and eight numbers you have (83, 86, 6, 31, 17, 9, 48, and 53). Of the numbers you have, four of them (48, 83, 17, and 86) are winning numbers! That means card 1 is worth 8 points (1 for the first match, then doubled three times for each of the three matches after the first).\n\nCard 2 has two winning numbers (32 and 61), so it is worth 2 points.\nCard 3 has two winning numbers (1 and 21), so it is worth 2 points.\nCard 4 has one winning number (84), so it is worth 1 point.\nCard 5 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.\nCard 6 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.\nSo, in this example, the Elf's pile of scratchcards is worth 13 points.\n\nTake a seat in the large pile of colorful cards. How many points are they worth in total?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var buf_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n\n    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    var total_points: u32 = 0;\n\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |line| {\n        var it = std.mem.split(u8, line, \" | \");\n        const winning_numbers = it.next().?;\n        const your_numbers = it.next().?;\n        total_points += calculatePoints(winning_numbers, your_numbers);\n    }\n\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{total_points});\n}\n\nfn calculatePoints(winning_numbers: []const u8, your_numbers: []const u8) u32 {\n    var points: u32 = 0;\n    var winning_set = std.bit_set.IntegerBitSet(100).initEmpty();\n\n    var it = std.mem.tokenize(u8, winning_numbers, \" \");\n    while (it.next()) |num_str| {\n        const num = std.fmt.parseInt(u8, num_str, 10) catch continue;\n        winning_set.set(num);\n    }\n\n    it = std.mem.tokenize(u8, your_numbers, \" \");\n    while (it.next()) |num_str| {\n        const num = std.fmt.parseInt(u8, num_str, 10) catch continue;\n        if (winning_set.isSet(num)) {\n            points = if (points == 0) 1 else points * 2;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return points;\n}\n```\n"}]}

You go inside.\n\nIt doesn't take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they're not moving.\n\n\"Aaah!\"\n\nYou turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. \"Sorry, I wasn't expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn't working right now; it'll still be a while before I can fix it.\" You offer to help.\n\nThe engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can add up all the part numbers in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.\n\nThe engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a \"part number\" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not count as a symbol.)\n\nHere is an example engine schematic:\n\n467..114..\n...*......\n..35..633.\n......#...\n617*......\n.....+.58.\n..592.....\n......755.\n...$.*....\n.664.598..\nIn this schematic, two numbers are not part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: 114 (top right) and 58 (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so is a part number; their sum is 4361.\n\nOf course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 546563.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe engineer finds the missing part and installs it in the engine! As the engine springs to life, you jump in the closest gondola, finally ready to ascend to the water source.\n\nYou don't seem to be going very fast, though. Maybe something is still wrong? Fortunately, the gondola has a phone labeled \"help\", so you pick it up and the engineer answers.\n\nBefore you can explain the situation, she suggests that you look out the window. There stands the engineer, holding a phone in one hand and waving with the other. You're going so slowly that you haven't even left the station. You exit the gondola.\n\nThe missing part wasn't the only issue - one of the gears in the engine is wrong. A gear is any * symbol that is adjacent to exactly two part numbers. Its gear ratio is the result of multiplying those two numbers together.\n\nThis time, you need to find the gear ratio of every gear and add them all up so that the engineer can figure out which gear needs to be replaced.\n\nConsider the same engine schematic again:\n\n467..114..\n...*......\n..35..633.\n......#...\n617*......\n.....+.58.\n..592.....\n......755.\n...$.*....\n.664.598..\nIn this schematic, there are two gears. The first is in the top left; it has part numbers 467 and 35, so its gear ratio is 16345. The second gear is in the lower right; its gear ratio is 451490. (The * adjacent to 617 is not a gear because it is only adjacent to one part number.) Adding up all of the gear ratios produces 467835.\n\nWhat is the sum of all of the gear ratios in your engine schematic?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nconst Neighbor = struct { dx: i32, dy: i32 };\nconst Neighbors8 = [_]Neighbor{\n    .{ .dx = 0, .dy = 1 },  .{ .dx = 0, .dy = -1 },\n    .{ .dx = 1, .dy = 0 },  .{ .dx = -1, .dy = 0 },\n    .{ .dx = -1, .dy = -1 }, .{ .dx = -1, .dy = 1 },\n    .{ .dx = 1, .dy = -1 },  .{ .dx = 1, .dy = 1 },\n};\n\nconst Part = struct {\n    xmin: usize,\n    xmax: usize,\n    y: usize,\n    n: u32,\n};\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const input = try std.fs.cwd().readFileAlloc(allocator, \"input.txt\", 1024 * 1024);\n    defer allocator.free(input);\n\n    var grid = std.AutoHashMap(struct { x: usize, y: usize }, u8).init(allocator);\n    defer grid.deinit();\n\n    var parts = std.ArrayList(Part).init(allocator);\n    defer parts.deinit();\n\n    var y: usize = 0;\n    var x: usize = 0;\n    var curr: ?Part = null;\n\n    for (input) |c| {\n        if (c == '\\n') {\n            if (curr) |p| {\n                try parts.append(p);\n                curr = null;\n            }\n            y += 1;\n            x = 0;\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        try grid.put(.{ .x = x, .y = y }, c);\n\n        if (c >= '0' and c <= '9') {\n            if (curr) |*p| {\n                p.xmax = x;\n                p.n = p.n * 10 + (c - '0');\n            } else {\n                curr = Part{ .xmin = x, .xmax = x, .y = y, .n = c - '0' };\n            }\n        } else if (curr != null) {\n            try parts.append(curr.?);\n            curr = null;\n        }\n\n        x += 1;\n    }\n\n    if (curr) |p| {\n        try parts.append(p);\n    }\n\n    var partsGrid = std.AutoHashMap(struct { x: usize, y: usize }, usize).init(allocator);\n    defer partsGrid.deinit();\n\n    for (parts.items, 0..) |p, i| {\n        var px = p.xmin;\n        while (px <= p.xmax) : (px += 1) {\n            try partsGrid.put(.{ .x = px, .y = p.y }, i);\n        }\n    }\n\n    var sum: u32 = 0;\n    var it = grid.iterator();\n    while (it.next()) |entry| {\n        if (entry.value_ptr.* == '*') {\n            var neighborParts = std.AutoHashMap(usize, void).init(allocator);\n            defer neighborParts.deinit();\n\n            for (Neighbors8) |n| {\n                const nx = @as(i32, @intCast(entry.key_ptr.x)) + n.dx;\n                const ny = @as(i32, @intCast(entry.key_ptr.y)) + n.dy;\n                if (nx >= 0 and ny >= 0) {\n                    if (partsGrid.get(.{ .x = @intCast(nx), .y = @intCast(ny) })) |i| {\n                        try neighborParts.put(i, {});\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            if (neighborParts.count() == 2) {\n                var prod: u32 = 1;\n                var nit = neighborParts.keyIterator();\n                while (nit.next()) |i| {\n                    prod *= parts.items[i.*].n;\n                }\n                sum += prod;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    try std.io.getStdOut().writer().print(\"{}\\n\", .{sum});\n}\n```\n"}]}

The apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky. You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It's quite cold, but you don't see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you.\n\nThe Elf explains that you've arrived at Snow Island and apologizes for the lack of snow. He'll be happy to explain the situation, but it's a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don't get many visitors up here; would you like to play a game in the meantime?\n\nAs you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.\n\nTo get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.\n\nYou play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).\n\nFor example, the record of a few games might look like this:\n\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\nGame 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\nGame 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\nGame 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\nIn game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.\n\nThe Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?\n\nIn the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been impossible because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get 8.\n\nDetermine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. What is the sum of the IDs of those games?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 2207.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe Elf says they've stopped producing snow because they aren't getting any water! He isn't sure why the water stopped; however, he can show you how to get to the water source to check it out for yourself. It's just up ahead!\n\nAs you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible?\n\nAgain consider the example games from earlier:\n\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\nGame 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\nGame 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\nGame 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\nIn game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible.\nGame 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes.\nGame 3 must have been played with at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes.\nGame 4 required at least 14 red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes.\nGame 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3 green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag.\nThe power of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together. The power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1 is 48. In games 2-5 it was 12, 1560, 630, and 36, respectively. Adding up these five powers produces the sum 2286.\n\nFor each game, find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present.

Crews quickly start unloading the equipment the balloons brought: many hot air balloon kits, some fuel tanks, and a fuel heating machine.\n\nThe fuel heating machine is a new addition to the process. When this mountain was a volcano, the ambient temperature was more reasonable; now, it's so cold that the fuel won't work at all without being warmed up first.\n\nThe Elves, seemingly in an attempt to make the new machine feel welcome, have already attached a pair of googly eyes and started calling it \"Bob\".\n\nTo heat the fuel, Bob needs to know the total amount of fuel that will be processed ahead of time so it can correctly calibrate heat output and flow rate. This amount is simply the sum of the fuel requirements of all of the hot air balloons, and those fuel requirements are even listed clearly on the side of each hot air balloon's burner.\n\nYou assume the Elves will have no trouble adding up some numbers and are about to go back to figuring out which balloon is yours when you get a tap on the shoulder. Apparently, the fuel requirements use numbers written in a format the Elves don't recognize; predictably, they'd like your help deciphering them.\n\nYou make a list of all of the fuel requirements (your puzzle input), but you don't recognize the number format either. For example:\n\n1=-0-2\n12111\n2=0=\n21\n2=01\n111\n20012\n112\n1=-1=\n1-12\n12\n1=\n122\nFortunately, Bob is labeled with a support phone number. Not to be deterred, you call and ask for help.\n\n\"That's right, just supply the fuel amount to the-- oh, for more than one burner? No problem, you just need to add together our Special Numeral-Analogue Fuel Units. Patent pending! They're way better than normal numbers for--\"\n\nYou mention that it's quite cold up here and ask if they can skip ahead.\n\n\"Okay, our Special Numeral-Analogue Fuel Units - SNAFU for short - are sort of like normal numbers. You know how starting on the right, normal numbers have a ones place, a tens place, a hundreds place, and so on, where the digit in each place tells you how many of that value you have?\"\n\n\"SNAFU works the same way, except it uses powers of five instead of ten. Starting from the right, you have a ones place, a fives place, a twenty-fives place, a one-hundred-and-twenty-fives place, and so on. It's that easy!\"\n\nYou ask why some of the digits look like - or = instead of \"digits\".\n\n\"You know, I never did ask the engineers why they did that. Instead of using digits four through zero, the digits are 2, 1, 0, minus (written -), and double-minus (written =). Minus is worth -1, and double-minus is worth -2.\"\n\n\"So, because ten (in normal numbers) is two fives and no ones, in SNAFU it is written 20. Since eight (in normal numbers) is two fives minus two ones, it is written 2=.\"\n\n\"You can do it the other direction, too. Say you have the SNAFU number 2=-01. That's 2 in the 625s place, = (double-minus) in the 125s place, - (minus) in the 25s place, 0 in the 5s place, and 1 in the 1s place. (2 times 625) plus (-2 times 125) plus (-1 times 25) plus (0 times 5) plus (1 times 1). That's 1250 plus -250 plus -25 plus 0 plus 1. 976!\"\n\n\"I see here that you're connected via our premium uplink service, so I'll transmit our handy SNAFU brochure to you now. Did you need anything else?\"\n\nYou ask if the fuel will even work in these temperatures.\n\n\"Wait, it's how cold? There's no way the fuel - or any fuel - would work in those conditions! There are only a few places in the-- where did you say you are again?\"\n\nJust then, you notice one of the Elves pour a few drops from a snowflake-shaped container into one of the fuel tanks, thank the support representative for their time, and disconnect the call.\n\nThe SNAFU brochure contains a few more examples of decimal (\"normal\") numbers and their SNAFU counterparts:\n\n  Decimal          SNAFU\n        1              1\n        2              2\n        3             1=\n        4             1-\n        5             10\n        6             11\n        7             12\n        8             2=\n        9             2-\n       10             20\n       15            1=0\n       20            1-0\n     2022         1=11-2\n    12345        1-0---0\n314159265  1121-1110-1=0\nBased on this process, the SNAFU numbers in the example above can be converted to decimal numbers as follows:\n\n SNAFU  Decimal\n1=-0-2     1747\n 12111      906\n  2=0=      198\n    21       11\n  2=01      201\n   111       31\n 20012     1257\n   112       32\n 1=-1=      353\n  1-12      107\n    12        7\n    1=        3\n   122       37\nIn decimal, the sum of these numbers is 4890.\n\nAs you go to input this number on Bob's console, you discover that some buttons you expected are missing. Instead, you are met with buttons labeled =, -, 0, 1, and 2. Bob needs the input value expressed as a SNAFU number, not in decimal.\n\nReversing the process, you can determine that for the decimal number 4890, the SNAFU number you need to supply to Bob's console is 2=-1=0.\n\nThe Elves are starting to get cold.

Outside the cave, you can see the lava landing in a pond and hear it loudly hissing as it solidifies.\n\nDepending on the specific compounds in the lava and speed at which it cools, it might be forming obsidian! The cooling rate should be based on the surface area of the lava droplets, so you take a quick scan of a droplet as it flies past you (your puzzle input).\n\nBecause of how quickly the lava is moving, the scan isn't very good; its resolution is quite low and, as a result, it approximates the shape of the lava droplet with 1x1x1 cubes on a 3D grid, each given as its x,y,z position.\n\nTo approximate the surface area, count the number of sides of each cube that are not immediately connected to another cube.

The steam will expand to reach as much as possible, completely displacing any air on the outside of the lava droplet but never expanding diagonally.\n\nIn the larger example above, exactly one cube of air is trapped within the lava droplet (at 2,2,5), so the exterior surface area of the lava droplet is 58.\n\nWhat is the exterior surface area of your scanned lava droplet?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nconst Pt3 = struct {\n    x: i32,\n    y: i32,\n    z: i32,\n};\n\nfn addPt3(p1: Pt3, p2: Pt3) Pt3 {\n    return Pt3{ .x = p1.x + p2.x, .y = p1.y + p2.y, .z = p1.z + p2.z };\n}\n\nfn minInt(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {\n    return if (a < b) a else b;\n}\n\nfn maxInt(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {\n    return if (a > b) a else b;\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);\n    defer arena.deinit();\n\n    const allocator = arena.allocator();\n\n    var cubes = std.AutoHashMap(Pt3, void).init(allocator);\n    defer cubes.deinit();\n\n    const neighbors = [6]Pt3{\n        Pt3{ .x = -1, .y = 0, .z = 0 },\n        Pt3{ .x = 1, .y = 0, .z = 0 },\n        Pt3{ .x = 0, .y = -1, .z = 0 },\n        Pt3{ .x = 0, .y = 1, .z = 0 },\n        Pt3{ .x = 0, .y = 0, .z = -1 },\n        Pt3{ .x = 0, .y = 0, .z = 1 },\n    };\n\n    var min_pt = Pt3{ .x = std.math.maxInt(i32), .y = std.math.maxInt(i32), .z = std.math.maxInt(i32) };\n    var max_pt = Pt3{ .x = std.math.minInt(i32), .y = std.math.minInt(i32), .z = std.math.minInt(i32) };\n\n    var file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var reader = file.reader();\n    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    var line_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(reader);\n    var in = line_reader.reader();\n\n    while (try in.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(buf[0..], '\\n')) |line| {\n        if (line.len == 0) continue;\n\n        var parts = std.mem.split(u8, line, \",\");\n        const x = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, parts.next().?, 10);\n        const y = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, parts.next().?, 10);\n        const z = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, parts.next().?, 10);\n\n        const cube = Pt3{ .x = x, .y = y, .z = z };\n        try cubes.put(cube, {});\n\n        min_pt = Pt3{\n            .x = minInt(min_pt.x, cube.x),\n            .y = minInt(min_pt.y, cube.y),\n            .z = minInt(min_pt.z, cube.z),\n        };\n        max_pt = Pt3{\n            .x = maxInt(max_pt.x, cube.x),\n            .y = maxInt(max_pt.y, cube.y),\n            .z = maxInt(max_pt.z, cube.z),\n        };\n    }\n\n    min_pt = addPt3(min_pt, Pt3{ .x = -1, .y = -1, .z = -1 });\n    max_pt = addPt3(max_pt, Pt3{ .x = 1, .y = 1, .z = 1 });\n\n    var faces: usize = 0;\n    var queue = std.ArrayList(Pt3).init(allocator);\n    defer queue.deinit();\n\n    var seen = std.AutoHashMap(Pt3, void).init(allocator);\n    defer seen.deinit();\n\n    try seen.put(min_pt, {});\n    try queue.append(min_pt);\n\n    while (queue.items.len > 0) {\n        const curr = queue.pop();\n\n        for (neighbors) |delta| {\n            const next = addPt3(curr, delta);\n            if (next.x < min_pt.x or\n                next.y < min_pt.y or\n                next.z < min_pt.z or\n                next.x > max_pt.x or\n                next.y > max_pt.y or\n                next.z > max_pt.z)\n            {\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            if (cubes.contains(next)) {\n                faces += 1;\n            } else if (!seen.contains(next)) {\n                try seen.put(next, {});\n                try queue.append(next);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    std.debug.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{faces});\n}\n```\n"}]}

So, if your scan were only two adjacent cubes like 1,1,1 and 2,1,1, each cube would have a single side covered and five sides exposed, a total surface area of 10 sides.\n\nHere's a larger example:\n\n2,2,2\n1,2,2\n3,2,2\n2,1,2\n2,3,2\n2,2,1\n2,2,3\n2,2,4\n2,2,6\n1,2,5\n3,2,5\n2,1,5\n2,3,5\nIn the above example, after counting up all the sides that aren't connected to another cube, the total surface area is 64.\n\nWhat is the surface area of your scanned lava droplet?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nconst Point = struct {\n    x: i32,\n    y: i32,\n    z: i32,\n};\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);\n    defer arena.deinit();\n    const allocator = arena.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var cubes = std.AutoHashMap(Point, void).init(allocator);\n    defer cubes.deinit();\n\n    var buf_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n\n    var buf: [64]u8 = undefined;\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |line| {\n        var it = std.mem.split(u8, line, \",\");\n        const x = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, it.next().?, 10);\n        const y = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, it.next().?, 10);\n        const z = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, it.next().?, 10);\n        try cubes.put(Point{ .x = x, .y = y, .z = z }, {});\n    }\n\n    var surface_area: u32 = 0;\n    var it = cubes.keyIterator();\n    while (it.next()) |cube| {\n        surface_area += calculateExposedSides(cube.*, cubes);\n    }\n\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"{}\\n\", .{surface_area});\n}\n\nfn calculateExposedSides(p: Point, cubes: std.AutoHashMap(Point, void)) u32 {\n    const directions = [_]Point{\n        .{ .x = 1, .y = 0, .z = 0 },  .{ .x = -1, .y = 0, .z = 0 },\n        .{ .x = 0, .y = 1, .z = 0 },  .{ .x = 0, .y = -1, .z = 0 },\n        .{ .x = 0, .y = 0, .z = 1 },  .{ .x = 0, .y = 0, .z = -1 },\n    };\n\n    var exposed_sides: u32 = 6;\n    for (directions) |dir| {\n        const adjacent = Point{\n            .x = p.x + dir.x,\n            .y = p.y + dir.y,\n            .z = p.z + dir.z,\n        };\n        if (cubes.contains(adjacent)) {\n            exposed_sides -= 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return exposed_sides;\n}\n```\n"}]}

The ground is rumbling almost continuously now, but the strange valves bought you some time. It's definitely getting warmer in here, though.\n\nThe tunnels eventually open into a very tall, narrow chamber. Large, oddly-shaped rocks are falling into the chamber from above, presumably due to all the rumbling. If you can't work out where the rocks will fall next, you might be crushed!\n\nThe five types of rocks have the following peculiar shapes, where # is rock and . is empty space:\n\n####\n\n.#.\n###\n.#.\n\n..#\n..#\n###\n\n#\n#\n#\n#\n\n##\n##\nThe rocks fall in the order shown above: first the - shape, then the + shape, and so on. Once the end of the list is reached, the same order repeats: the - shape falls first, sixth, 11th, 16th, etc.\n\nThe rocks don't spin, but they do get pushed around by jets of hot gas coming out of the walls themselves. A quick scan reveals the effect the jets of hot gas will have on the rocks as they fall (your puzzle input).\n\nFor example, suppose this was the jet pattern in your cave:\n\n>>><<><>><<<>><>>><<<>>><<<><<<>><>><<>>\nIn jet patterns, < means a push to the left, while > means a push to the right. The pattern above means that the jets will push a falling rock right, then right, then right, then left, then left, then right, and so on. If the end of the list is reached, it repeats.\n\nThe tall, vertical chamber is exactly seven units wide. Each rock appears so that its left edge is two units away from the left wall and its bottom edge is three units above the highest rock in the room (or the floor, if there isn't one).\n\nAfter a rock appears, it alternates between being pushed by a jet of hot gas one unit (in the direction indicated by the next symbol in the jet pattern) and then falling one unit down. If any movement would cause any part of the rock to move into the walls, floor, or a stopped rock, the movement instead does not occur. If a downward movement would have caused a falling rock to move into the floor or an already-fallen rock, the falling rock stops where it is (having landed on something) and a new rock immediately begins falling.\n\nDrawing falling rocks with @ and stopped rocks with #, the jet pattern in the example above manifests as follows:\n\nThe first rock begins falling:\n|..@@@@.|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n+-------+\n\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\n|...@@@@|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n+-------+\n\nRock falls 1 unit:\n|...@@@@|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n+-------+\n\nJet of gas pushes rock right, but nothing happens:\n|...@@@@|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n+-------+\n\nRock falls 1 unit:\n|...@@@@|\n|.......|\n+-------+\n\nJet of gas pushes rock right, but nothing happens:\n|...@@@@|\n|.......|\n+-------+\n\nRock falls 1 unit:\n|...@@@@|\n+-------+\n\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\n|..@@@@.|\n+-------+\n\nRock falls 1 unit, causing it to come to rest:\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\nA new rock begins falling:\n|...@...|\n|..@@@..|\n|...@...|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\n|..@....|\n|.@@@...|\n|..@....|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\nRock falls 1 unit:\n|..@....|\n|.@@@...|\n|..@....|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\n|...@...|\n|..@@@..|\n|...@...|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\nRock falls 1 unit:\n|...@...|\n|..@@@..|\n|...@...|\n|.......|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\nJet of gas pushes rock left:\n|..@....|\n|.@@@...|\n|..@....|\n|.......|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\nRock falls 1 unit:\n|..@....|\n|.@@@...|\n|..@....|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\nJet of gas pushes rock right:\n|...@...|\n|..@@@..|\n|...@...|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\nRock falls 1 unit, causing it to come to rest:\n|...#...|\n|..###..|\n|...#...|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\nA new rock begins falling:\n|....@..|\n|....@..|\n|..@@@..|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|...#...|\n|..###..|\n|...#...|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\nThe moment each of the next few rocks begins falling, you would see this:\n\n|..@....|\n|..@....|\n|..@....|\n|..@....|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|..#....|\n|..#....|\n|####...|\n|..###..|\n|...#...|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\n|..@@...|\n|..@@...|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|....#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|#####..|\n|..###..|\n|...#...|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\n|..@@@@.|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|....##.|\n|....##.|\n|....#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|#####..|\n|..###..|\n|...#...|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\n|...@...|\n|..@@@..|\n|...@...|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.####..|\n|....##.|\n|....##.|\n|....#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|#####..|\n|..###..|\n|...#...|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\n|....@..|\n|....@..|\n|..@@@..|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|..#....|\n|.###...|\n|..#....|\n|.####..|\n|....##.|\n|....##.|\n|....#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|#####..|\n|..###..|\n|...#...|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\n|..@....|\n|..@....|\n|..@....|\n|..@....|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.....#.|\n|.....#.|\n|..####.|\n|.###...|\n|..#....|\n|.####..|\n|....##.|\n|....##.|\n|....#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|#####..|\n|..###..|\n|...#...|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\n|..@@...|\n|..@@...|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|....#..|\n|....#..|\n|....##.|\n|....##.|\n|..####.|\n|.###...|\n|..#....|\n|.####..|\n|....##.|\n|....##.|\n|....#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|#####..|\n|..###..|\n|...#...|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\n\n|..@@@@.|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|.......|\n|....#..|\n|....#..|\n|....##.|\n|##..##.|\n|######.|\n|.###...|\n|..#....|\n|.####..|\n|....##.|\n|....##.|\n|....#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|..#.#..|\n|#####..|\n|..###..|\n|...#...|\n|..####.|\n+-------+\nTo prove to the elephants your simulation is accurate, they want to know how tall the tower will get after 2022 rocks have stopped (but before the 2023rd rock begins falling).

Actually, hang on - the signal seems like it's coming from the waterfall itself, and that doesn't make any sense. However, you do notice a little path that leads behind the waterfall.\n\nCorrection: the distress signal leads you behind a giant waterfall! There seems to be a large cave system here, and the signal definitely leads further inside.\n\nAs you begin to make your way deeper underground, you feel the ground rumble for a moment. Sand begins pouring into the cave! If you don't quickly figure out where the sand is going, you could quickly become trapped!\n\nFortunately, your familiarity with analyzing the path of falling material will come in handy here. You scan a two-dimensional vertical slice of the cave above you (your puzzle input) and discover that it is mostly air with structures made of rock.\n\nYour scan traces the path of each solid rock structure and reports the x,y coordinates that form the shape of the path, where x represents distance to the right and y represents distance down. Each path appears as a single line of text in your scan. After the first point of each path, each point indicates the end of a straight horizontal or vertical line to be drawn from the previous point. For example:\n\n498,4 -> 498,6 -> 496,6\n503,4 -> 502,4 -> 502,9 -> 494,9\nThis scan means that there are two paths of rock; the first path consists of two straight lines, and the second path consists of three straight lines. (Specifically, the first path consists of a line of rock from 498,4 through 498,6 and another line of rock from 498,6 through 496,6.)\n\nThe sand is pouring into the cave from point 500,0.\n\nDrawing rock as #, air as ., and the source of the sand as +, this becomes:\n\n\n  4     5  5\n  9     0  0\n  4     0  3\n0 ......+...\n1 ..........\n2 ..........\n3 ..........\n4 ....#...##\n5 ....#...#.\n6 ..###...#.\n7 ........#.\n8 ........#.\n9 #########.\nSand is produced one unit at a time, and the next unit of sand is not produced until the previous unit of sand comes to rest. A unit of sand is large enough to fill one tile of air in your scan.\n\nA unit of sand always falls down one step if possible. If the tile immediately below is blocked (by rock or sand), the unit of sand attempts to instead move diagonally one step down and to the left. If that tile is blocked, the unit of sand attempts to instead move diagonally one step down and to the right. Sand keeps moving as long as it is able to do so, at each step trying to move down, then down-left, then down-right. If all three possible destinations are blocked, the unit of sand comes to rest and no longer moves, at which point the next unit of sand is created back at the source.\n\nSo, drawing sand that has come to rest as o, the first unit of sand simply falls straight down and then stops:\n\n......+...\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....#...##\n....#...#.\n..###...#.\n........#.\n......o.#.\n#########.\nThe second unit of sand then falls straight down, lands on the first one, and then comes to rest to its left:\n\n......+...\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....#...##\n....#...#.\n..###...#.\n........#.\n.....oo.#.\n#########.\nAfter a total of five units of sand have come to rest, they form this pattern:\n\n......+...\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....#...##\n....#...#.\n..###...#.\n......o.#.\n....oooo#.\n#########.\nAfter a total of 22 units of sand:\n\n......+...\n..........\n......o...\n.....ooo..\n....#ooo##\n....#ooo#.\n..###ooo#.\n....oooo#.\n...ooooo#.\n#########.\nFinally, only two more units of sand can possibly come to rest:\n\n......+...\n..........\n......o...\n.....ooo..\n....#ooo##\n...o#ooo#.\n..###ooo#.\n....oooo#.\n.o.ooooo#.\n#########.\nOnce all 24 units of sand shown above have come to rest, all further sand flows out the bottom, falling into the endless void. Just for fun, the path any new sand takes before falling forever is shown here with ~:\n\n.......+...\n.......~...\n......~o...\n.....~ooo..\n....~#ooo##\n...~o#ooo#.\n..~###ooo#.\n..~..oooo#.\n.~o.ooooo#.\n~#########.\n~..........\n~..........\n~..........\nUsing your scan, simulate the falling sand. How many units of sand come to rest before sand starts flowing into the abyss below?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 696.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nYou realize you misread the scan. There isn't an endless void at the bottom of the scan - there's floor, and you're standing on it!\n\nYou don't have time to scan the floor, so assume the floor is an infinite horizontal line with a y coordinate equal to two plus the highest y coordinate of any point in your scan.\n\nIn the example above, the highest y coordinate of any point is 9, and so the floor is at y=11. (This is as if your scan contained one extra rock path like -infinity,11 -> infinity,11.)

Actually, hang on - the signal seems like it's coming from the waterfall itself, and that doesn't make any sense. However, you do notice a little path that leads behind the waterfall.\n\nCorrection: the distress signal leads you behind a giant waterfall! There seems to be a large cave system here, and the signal definitely leads further inside.\n\nAs you begin to make your way deeper underground, you feel the ground rumble for a moment. Sand begins pouring into the cave! If you don't quickly figure out where the sand is going, you could quickly become trapped!\n\nFortunately, your familiarity with analyzing the path of falling material will come in handy here. You scan a two-dimensional vertical slice of the cave above you (your puzzle input) and discover that it is mostly air with structures made of rock.\n\nYour scan traces the path of each solid rock structure and reports the x,y coordinates that form the shape of the path, where x represents distance to the right and y represents distance down. Each path appears as a single line of text in your scan. After the first point of each path, each point indicates the end of a straight horizontal or vertical line to be drawn from the previous point. For example:\n\n498,4 -> 498,6 -> 496,6\n503,4 -> 502,4 -> 502,9 -> 494,9\nThis scan means that there are two paths of rock; the first path consists of two straight lines, and the second path consists of three straight lines. (Specifically, the first path consists of a line of rock from 498,4 through 498,6 and another line of rock from 498,6 through 496,6.)\n\nThe sand is pouring into the cave from point 500,0.\n\nDrawing rock as #, air as ., and the source of the sand as +, this becomes:\n\n\n  4     5  5\n  9     0  0\n  4     0  3\n0 ......+...\n1 ..........\n2 ..........\n3 ..........\n4 ....#...##\n5 ....#...#.\n6 ..###...#.\n7 ........#.\n8 ........#.\n9 #########.\nSand is produced one unit at a time, and the next unit of sand is not produced until the previous unit of sand comes to rest. A unit of sand is large enough to fill one tile of air in your scan.\n\nA unit of sand always falls down one step if possible. If the tile immediately below is blocked (by rock or sand), the unit of sand attempts to instead move diagonally one step down and to the left. If that tile is blocked, the unit of sand attempts to instead move diagonally one step down and to the right. Sand keeps moving as long as it is able to do so, at each step trying to move down, then down-left, then down-right. If all three possible destinations are blocked, the unit of sand comes to rest and no longer moves, at which point the next unit of sand is created back at the source.\n\nSo, drawing sand that has come to rest as o, the first unit of sand simply falls straight down and then stops:\n\n......+...\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....#...##\n....#...#.\n..###...#.\n........#.\n......o.#.\n#########.\nThe second unit of sand then falls straight down, lands on the first one, and then comes to rest to its left:\n\n......+...\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....#...##\n....#...#.\n..###...#.\n........#.\n.....oo.#.\n#########.\nAfter a total of five units of sand have come to rest, they form this pattern:\n\n......+...\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....#...##\n....#...#.\n..###...#.\n......o.#.\n....oooo#.\n#########.\nAfter a total of 22 units of sand:\n\n......+...\n..........\n......o...\n.....ooo..\n....#ooo##\n....#ooo#.\n..###ooo#.\n....oooo#.\n...ooooo#.\n#########.\nFinally, only two more units of sand can possibly come to rest:\n\n......+...\n..........\n......o...\n.....ooo..\n....#ooo##\n...o#ooo#.\n..###ooo#.\n....oooo#.\n.o.ooooo#.\n#########.\nOnce all 24 units of sand shown above have come to rest, all further sand flows out the bottom, falling into the endless void.

The heightmap shows the local area from above broken into a grid; the elevation of each square of the grid is given by a single lowercase letter, where a is the lowest elevation, b is the next-lowest, and so on up to the highest elevation, z.\n\nAlso included on the heightmap are marks for your current position (S) and the location that should get the best signal (E). Your current position (S) has elevation a, and the location that should get the best signal (E) has elevation z.\n\nYou'd like to reach E, but to save energy, you should do it in as few steps as possible. During each step, you can move exactly one square up, down, left, or right. To avoid needing to get out your climbing gear, the elevation of the destination square can be at most one higher than the elevation of your current square; that is, if your current elevation is m, you could step to elevation n, but not to elevation o. (This also means that the elevation of the destination square can be much lower than the elevation of your current square.)\n\nFor example:\n\nSabqponm\nabcryxxl\naccszExk\nacctuvwj\nabdefghi\nHere, you start in the top-left corner; your goal is near the middle. You could start by moving down or right, but eventually you'll need to head toward the e at the bottom.

The location that should get the best signal is still E, and . marks unvisited squares.\n\nThis path reaches the goal in 31 steps, the fewest possible.\n\nWhat is the fewest steps required to move from your current position to the location that should get the best signal?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 423.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nAs you walk up the hill, you suspect that the Elves will want to turn this into a hiking trail. The beginning isn't very scenic, though; perhaps you can find a better starting point.\n\nTo maximize exercise while hiking, the trail should start as low as possible: elevation a. The goal is still the square marked E. However, the trail should still be direct, taking the fewest steps to reach its goal. So, you'll need to find the shortest path from any square at elevation a to the square marked E.\n\nAgain consider the example from above:\n\nSabqponm\nabcryxxl\naccszExk\nacctuvwj\nabdefghi\nNow, there are six choices for starting position (five marked a, plus the square marked S that counts as being at elevation a).

You pull it out of your pack, but the amount of water slowly draining from a big crack in its screen tells you it probably won't be of much immediate use.\n\nUnless, that is, you can design a replacement for the device's video system! It seems to be some kind of cathode-ray tube screen and simple CPU that are both driven by a precise clock circuit. The clock circuit ticks at a constant rate; each tick is called a cycle.\n\nStart by figuring out the signal being sent by the CPU. The CPU has a single register, X, which starts with the value 1. It supports only two instructions:\n\naddx V takes two cycles to complete. After two cycles, the X register is increased by the value V. (V can be negative.)\nnoop takes one cycle to complete. It has no other effect.\nThe CPU uses these instructions in a program (your puzzle input) to, somehow, tell the screen what to draw.\n\nConsider the following small program:\n\nnoop\naddx 3\naddx -5\nExecution of this program proceeds as follows:\n\nAt the start of the first cycle, the noop instruction begins execution. During the first cycle, X is 1. After the first cycle, the noop instruction finishes execution, doing nothing.\nAt the start of the second cycle, the addx 3 instruction begins execution. During the second cycle, X is still 1.\nDuring the third cycle, X is still 1. After the third cycle, the addx 3 instruction finishes execution, setting X to 4.\nAt the start of the fourth cycle, the addx -5 instruction begins execution. During the fourth cycle, X is still 4.\nDuring the fifth cycle, X is still 4. After the fifth cycle, the addx -5 instruction finishes execution, setting X to -1.\nMaybe you can learn something by looking at the value of the X register throughout execution. For now, consider the signal strength (the cycle number multiplied by the value of the X register) during the 20th cycle and every 40 cycles after that (that is, during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles).\n\nFor example, consider this larger program:\n\naddx 15\naddx -11\naddx 6\naddx -3\naddx 5\naddx -1\naddx -8\naddx 13\naddx 4\nnoop\naddx -1\naddx 5\naddx -1\naddx 5\naddx -1\naddx 5\naddx -1\naddx 5\naddx -1\naddx -35\naddx 1\naddx 24\naddx -19\naddx 1\naddx 16\naddx -11\nnoop\nnoop\naddx 21\naddx -15\nnoop\nnoop\naddx -3\naddx 9\naddx 1\naddx -3\naddx 8\naddx 1\naddx 5\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\naddx -36\nnoop\naddx 1\naddx 7\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\naddx 2\naddx 6\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\naddx 1\nnoop\nnoop\naddx 7\naddx 1\nnoop\naddx -13\naddx 13\naddx 7\nnoop\naddx 1\naddx -33\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\naddx 2\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\naddx 8\nnoop\naddx -1\naddx 2\naddx 1\nnoop\naddx 17\naddx -9\naddx 1\naddx 1\naddx -3\naddx 11\nnoop\nnoop\naddx 1\nnoop\naddx 1\nnoop\nnoop\naddx -13\naddx -19\naddx 1\naddx 3\naddx 26\naddx -30\naddx 12\naddx -1\naddx 3\naddx 1\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\naddx -9\naddx 18\naddx 1\naddx 2\nnoop\nnoop\naddx 9\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\naddx -1\naddx 2\naddx -37\naddx 1\naddx 3\nnoop\naddx 15\naddx -21\naddx 22\naddx -6\naddx 1\nnoop\naddx 2\naddx 1\nnoop\naddx -10\nnoop\nnoop\naddx 20\naddx 1\naddx 2\naddx 2\naddx -6\naddx -11\nnoop\nnoop\nnoop\nThe interesting signal strengths can be determined as follows:\n\nDuring the 20th cycle, register X has the value 21, so the signal strength is 20 * 21 = 420. (The 20th cycle occurs in the middle of the second addx -1, so the value of register X is the starting value, 1, plus all of the other addx values up to that point: 1 + 15 - 11 + 6 - 3 + 5 - 1 - 8 + 13 + 4 = 21.)\nDuring the 60th cycle, register X has the value 19, so the signal strength is 60 * 19 = 1140.\nDuring the 100th cycle, register X has the value 18, so the signal strength is 100 * 18 = 1800.\nDuring the 140th cycle, register X has the value 21, so the signal strength is 140 * 21 = 2940.\nDuring the 180th cycle, register X has the value 16, so the signal strength is 180 * 16 = 2880.\nDuring the 220th cycle, register X has the value 18, so the signal strength is 220 * 18 = 3960.\nThe sum of these signal strengths is 13140.\n\nFind the signal strength during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles.

You aren't sure how old it is, or whether it can even support your weight.\n\nIt seems to support the Elves just fine, though. The bridge spans a gorge which was carved out by the massive river far below you.\n\nYou step carefully; as you do, the ropes stretch and twist. You decide to distract yourself by modeling rope physics; maybe you can even figure out where not to step.\n\nConsider a rope with a knot at each end; these knots mark the head and the tail of the rope. If the head moves far enough away from the tail, the tail is pulled toward the head.\n\nDue to nebulous reasoning involving Planck lengths, you should be able to model the positions of the knots on a two-dimensional grid. Then, by following a hypothetical series of motions (your puzzle input) for the head, you can determine how the tail will move.\n\nDue to the aforementioned Planck lengths, the rope must be quite short; in fact, the head (H) and tail (T) must always be touching (diagonally adjacent and even overlapping both count as touching):\n\n....\n.TH.\n....\n\n....\n.H..\n..T.\n....\n\n...\n.H. (H covers T)\n...\nIf the head is ever two steps directly up, down, left, or right from the tail, the tail must also move one step in that direction so it remains close enough:\n\n.....    .....    .....\n.TH.. -> .T.H. -> ..TH.\n.....    .....    .....\n\n...    ...    ...\n.T.    .T.    ...\n.H. -> ... -> .T.\n...    .H.    .H.\n...    ...    ...\nOtherwise, if the head and tail aren't touching and aren't in the same row or column, the tail always moves one step diagonally to keep up:\n\n.....    .....    .....\n.....    ..H..    ..H..\n..H.. -> ..... -> ..T..\n.T...    .T...    .....\n.....    .....    .....\n\n.....    .....    .....\n.....    .....    .....\n..H.. -> ...H. -> ..TH.\n.T...    .T...    .....\n.....    .....    .....\nYou just need to work out where the tail goes as the head follows a series of motions. Assume the head and the tail both start at the same position, overlapping.\n\nFor example:\n\nR 4\nU 4\nL 3\nD 1\nR 4\nD 1\nL 5\nR 2\nThis series of motions moves the head right four steps, then up four steps, then left three steps, then down one step, and so on. After each step, you'll need to update the position of the tail if the step means the head is no longer adjacent to the tail. Visually, these motions occur as follows (s marks the starting position as a reference point):\n\n== Initial State ==\n\n......\n......\n......\n......\nH.....

To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.\n\nRock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.\n\nAppreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. \"The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column--\" Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone's tent.\n\nThe second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.\n\nThe winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).\n\nSince you can't be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.\n\nFor example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:\n\nA Y\nB X\nC Z\nThis strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:\n\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).\nIn the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).\nThe third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.\nIn this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).\n\nWhat would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var line_reader = reader.reader();\n\n    var total_score: i32 = 0;\n\n    var buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    while (try line_reader.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buffer, '\\n')) |line| {\n        const opponent = line[0];\n        const your_move = line[2];\n\n        var score: i32 = 0;\n        if (your_move == 'X') {\n            score = 1;\n        } else if (your_move == 'Y') {\n            score = 2;\n        } else if (your_move == 'Z') {\n            score = 3;\n        }\n\n        if ((opponent == 'A' and your_move == 'Y') or (opponent == 'B' and your_move == 'Z') or (opponent == 'C' and your_move == 'X')) {\n            score += 6;\n        } else if ((opponent == 'A' and your_move == 'X') or (opponent == 'B' and your_move == 'Y') or (opponent == 'C' and your_move == 'Z')) {\n            score += 3;\n        }\n\n        total_score += score;\n    }\n\n    std.debug.print(\"{}\\n\", .{total_score});\n}\n```\n"}]}

For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.\n\nTo supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.\n\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n\nThe jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).\n\nThe Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.\n\nFor example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:\n\n1000\n2000\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n6000\n\n7000\n8000\n9000\n\n10000\nThis list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:\n\nThe first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.\nThe second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.\nThe third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.\nThe fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.\nThe fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.\nIn case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories.

The submarine computer challenges you to a nice game of Dirac Dice.\n\nThis game consists of a single die, two pawns, and a game board with a circular track containing ten spaces marked 1 through 10 clockwise. Each player's starting space is chosen randomly (your puzzle input). Player 1 goes first.\n\nPlayers take turns moving. On each player's turn, the player rolls the die three times and adds up the results. Then, the player moves their pawn that many times forward around the track (that is, moving clockwise on spaces in order of increasing value, wrapping back around to 1 after 10). So, if a player is on space 7 and they roll 2, 2, and 1, they would move forward 5 times, to spaces 8, 9, 10, 1, and finally stopping on 2.\n\nAfter each player moves, they increase their score by the value of the space their pawn stopped on. Players' scores start at 0. So, if the first player starts on space 7 and rolls a total of 5, they would stop on space 2 and add 2 to their score (for a total score of 2). The game immediately ends as a win for any player whose score reaches at least 1000.\n\nSince the first game is a practice game, the submarine opens a compartment labeled deterministic dice and a 100-sided die falls out. This die always rolls 1 first, then 2, then 3, and so on up to 100, after which it starts over at 1 again. Play using this die.\n\nFor example, given these starting positions:\n\nPlayer 1 starting position: 4\nPlayer 2 starting position: 8\nThis is how the game would go:\n\nPlayer 1 rolls 1+2+3 and moves to space 10 for a total score of 10.\nPlayer 2 rolls 4+5+6 and moves to space 3 for a total score of 3.\nPlayer 1 rolls 7+8+9 and moves to space 4 for a total score of 14.\nPlayer 2 rolls 10+11+12 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 9.\nPlayer 1 rolls 13+14+15 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 20.\nPlayer 2 rolls 16+17+18 and moves to space 7 for a total score of 16.\nPlayer 1 rolls 19+20+21 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 26.\nPlayer 2 rolls 22+23+24 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 22.\n...after many turns...\n\nPlayer 2 rolls 82+83+84 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 742.\nPlayer 1 rolls 85+86+87 and moves to space 4 for a total score of 990.\nPlayer 2 rolls 88+89+90 and moves to space 3 for a total score of 745.\nPlayer 1 rolls 91+92+93 and moves to space 10 for a final score, 1000.\nSince player 1 has at least 1000 points, player 1 wins and the game ends. At this point, the losing player had 745 points and the die had been rolled a total of 993 times; 745 * 993 = 739785.\n\nPlay a practice game using the deterministic 100-sided die. The moment either player wins, what do you get if you multiply the score of the losing player by the number of times the die was rolled during the game?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 1002474.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow that you're warmed up, it's time to play the real game.\n\nA second compartment opens, this time labeled Dirac dice. Out of it falls a single three-sided die.\n\nAs you experiment with the die, you feel a little strange. An informational brochure in the compartment explains that this is a quantum die: when you roll it, the universe splits into multiple copies, one copy for each possible outcome of the die. In this case, rolling the die always splits the universe into three copies: one where the outcome of the roll was 1, one where it was 2, and one where it was 3.\n\nThe game is played the same as before, although to prevent things from getting too far out of hand, the game now ends when either player's score reaches at least 21.\n\nUsing the same starting positions as in the example above, player 1 wins in 444356092776315 universes, while player 2 merely wins in 341960390180808 universes.\n\nUsing your given starting positions, determine every possible outcome.

Your submarine's computer has saved the transmission in hexadecimal (your puzzle input).\n\nThe first step of decoding the message is to convert the hexadecimal representation into binary. Each character of hexadecimal corresponds to four bits of binary data:\n\n0 = 0000\n1 = 0001\n2 = 0010\n3 = 0011\n4 = 0100\n5 = 0101\n6 = 0110\n7 = 0111\n8 = 1000\n9 = 1001\nA = 1010\nB = 1011\nC = 1100\nD = 1101\nE = 1110\nF = 1111\nThe BITS transmission contains a single packet at its outermost layer which itself contains many other packets. The hexadecimal representation of this packet might encode a few extra 0 bits at the end; these are not part of the transmission and should be ignored.\n\nEvery packet begins with a standard header: the first three bits encode the packet version, and the next three bits encode the packet type ID. These two values are numbers; all numbers encoded in any packet are represented as binary with the most significant bit first. For example, a version encoded as the binary sequence 100 represents the number 4.\n\nPackets with type ID 4 represent a literal value. Literal value packets encode a single binary number. To do this, the binary number is padded with leading zeroes until its length is a multiple of four bits, and then it is broken into groups of four bits. Each group is prefixed by a 1 bit except the last group, which is prefixed by a 0 bit. These groups of five bits immediately follow the packet header. For example, the hexadecimal string D2FE28 becomes:\n\n110100101111111000101000\nVVVTTTAAAAABBBBBCCCCC\nBelow each bit is a label indicating its purpose:\n\nThe three bits labeled V (110) are the packet version, 6.\nThe three bits labeled T (100) are the packet type ID, 4, which means the packet is a literal value.\nThe five bits labeled A (10111) start with a 1 (not the last group, keep reading) and contain the first four bits of the number, 0111.\nThe five bits labeled B (11110) start with a 1 (not the last group, keep reading) and contain four more bits of the number, 1110.\nThe five bits labeled C (00101) start with a 0 (last group, end of packet) and contain the last four bits of the number, 0101.\nThe three unlabeled 0 bits at the end are extra due to the hexadecimal representation and should be ignored.\nSo, this packet represents a literal value with binary representation 011111100101, which is 2021 in decimal.\n\nEvery other type of packet (any packet with a type ID other than 4) represent an operator that performs some calculation on one or more sub-packets contained within. Right now, the specific operations aren't important; focus on parsing the hierarchy of sub-packets.\n\nAn operator packet contains one or more packets. To indicate which subsequent binary data represents its sub-packets, an operator packet can use one of two modes indicated by the bit immediately after the packet header; this is called the length type ID:\n\nIf the length type ID is 0, then the next 15 bits are a number that represents the total length in bits of the sub-packets contained by this packet.\nIf the length type ID is 1, then the next 11 bits are a number that represents the number of sub-packets immediately contained by this packet.\nFinally, after the length type ID bit and the 15-bit or 11-bit field, the sub-packets appear.\n\nFor example, here is an operator packet (hexadecimal string 38006F45291200) with length type ID 0 that contains two sub-packets:\n\n00111000000000000110111101000101001010010001001000000000\nVVVTTTILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB\nThe three bits labeled V (001) are the packet version, 1.\nThe three bits labeled T (110) are the packet type ID, 6, which means the packet is an operator.\nThe bit labeled I (0) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 15-bit number representing the number of bits in the sub-packets.\nThe 15 bits labeled L (000000000011011) contain the length of the sub-packets in bits, 27.\nThe 11 bits labeled A contain the first sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 10.\nThe 16 bits labeled B contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 20.\nAfter reading 11 and 16 bits of sub-packet data, the total length indicated in L (27) is reached, and so parsing of this packet stops.\n\nAs another example, here is an operator packet (hexadecimal string EE00D40C823060) with length type ID 1 that contains three sub-packets:\n\n11101110000000001101010000001100100000100011000001100000\nVVVTTTILLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCC\nThe three bits labeled V (111) are the packet version, 7.\nThe three bits labeled T (011) are the packet type ID, 3, which means the packet is an operator.\nThe bit labeled I (1) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 11-bit number representing the number of sub-packets.\nThe 11 bits labeled L (00000000011) contain the number of sub-packets, 3.\nThe 11 bits labeled A contain the first sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 1.\nThe 11 bits labeled B contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 2.\nThe 11 bits labeled C contain the third sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 3.\nAfter reading 3 complete sub-packets, the number of sub-packets indicated in L (3) is reached, and so parsing of this packet stops.\n\nFor now, parse the hierarchy of the packets throughout the transmission and add up all of the version numbers.\n\nHere are a few more examples of hexadecimal-encoded transmissions:\n\n8A004A801A8002F478 represents an operator packet (version 4) which contains an operator packet (version 1) which contains an operator packet (version 5) which contains a literal value (version 6); this packet has a version sum of 16.\n620080001611562C8802118E34 represents an operator packet (version 3) which contains two sub-packets; each sub-packet is an operator packet that contains two literal values. This packet has a version sum of 12.\nC0015000016115A2E0802F182340 has the same structure as the previous example, but the outermost packet uses a different length type ID. This packet has a version sum of 23.\nA0016C880162017C3686B18A3D4780 is an operator packet that contains an operator packet that contains an operator packet that contains five literal values; it has a version sum of 31.\nDecode the structure of your hexadecimal-encoded BITS transmission; what do you get if you add up the version numbers in all packets?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nfn hexToBin(hex: []const u8, bin: []u8) void {\n    const lut = \"0000000100100011010001010110011110001001101010111100110111101111\";\n    for (hex, 0..) |h, i| {\n        const idx = (if (h <= '9') h - '0' else h - 'A' + 10) * 4;\n        @memcpy(bin[i * 4 .. i * 4 + 4], lut[idx .. idx + 4]);\n    }\n}\n\nfn parsePacket(bin: []const u8, idx: *usize) u64 {\n    const version = @as(u64, bin[idx.*] - '0') << 2 | @as(u64, bin[idx.* + 1] - '0') << 1 | @as(u64, bin[idx.* + 2] - '0');\n    const typeID = @as(u64, bin[idx.* + 3] - '0') << 2 | @as(u64, bin[idx.* + 4] - '0') << 1 | @as(u64, bin[idx.* + 5] - '0');\n    idx.* += 6;\n\n    if (typeID == 4) {\n        while (bin[idx.*] == '1') idx.* += 5;\n        idx.* += 5;\n        return version;\n    }\n\n    var versionSum: u64 = version;\n    const lengthTypeID = bin[idx.*] - '0';\n    idx.* += 1;\n\n    if (lengthTypeID == 0) {\n        var subPacketLength: usize = 0;\n        for (0..15) |_| {\n            subPacketLength = (subPacketLength << 1) | @as(usize, bin[idx.*] - '0');\n            idx.* += 1;\n        }\n        const endIdx = idx.* + subPacketLength;\n        while (idx.* < endIdx) {\n            versionSum += parsePacket(bin, idx);\n        }\n    } else {\n        var numSubPackets: usize = 0;\n        for (0..11) |_| {\n            numSubPackets = (numSubPackets << 1) | @as(usize, bin[idx.*] - '0');\n            idx.* += 1;\n        }\n        for (0..numSubPackets) |_| {\n            versionSum += parsePacket(bin, idx);\n        }\n    }\n    return versionSum;\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    const hex = try file.readToEndAlloc(allocator, 1024 * 1024);\n    defer allocator.free(hex);\n\n    const bin = try allocator.alloc(u8, hex.len * 4);\n    defer allocator.free(bin);\n\n    hexToBin(hex, bin);\n\n    var idx: usize = 0;\n    const versionSum = parsePacket(bin, &idx);\n\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{versionSum});\n}\n```\n"}]}

Your submarine can barely still fit, though; the main problem is that the walls of the cave are covered in chitons, and it would be best not to bump any of them.\n\nThe cavern is large, but has a very low ceiling, restricting your motion to two dimensions. The shape of the cavern resembles a square; a quick scan of chiton density produces a map of risk level throughout the cave (your puzzle input). For example:\n\n1163751742\n1381373672\n2136511328\n3694931569\n7463417111\n1319128137\n1359912421\n3125421639\n1293138521\n2311944581\nYou start in the top left position, your destination is the bottom right position, and you cannot move diagonally. The number at each position is its risk level; to determine the total risk of an entire path, add up the risk levels of each position you enter (that is, don't count the risk level of your starting position unless you enter it; leaving it adds no risk to your total).\n\nYour goal is to find a path with the lowest total risk. In this example, a path with the lowest total risk is highlighted here:\n\n1163751742\n1381373672\n2136511328\n3694931569\n7463417111\n1319128137\n1359912421\n3125421639\n1293138521\n2311944581\nThe total risk of this path is 40 (the starting position is never entered, so its risk is not counted).\n\nWhat is the lowest total risk of any path from the top left to the bottom right?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 398.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow that you know how to find low-risk paths in the cave, you can try to find your way out.\n\nThe entire cave is actually five times larger in both dimensions than you thought; the area you originally scanned is just one tile in a 5x5 tile area that forms the full map. Your original map tile repeats to the right and downward; each time the tile repeats to the right or downward, all of its risk levels are 1 higher than the tile immediately up or left of it. However, risk levels above 9 wrap back around to 1. So, if your original map had some position with a risk level of 8, then that same position on each of the 25 total tiles would be as follows:\n\n8 9 1 2 3\n9 1 2 3 4\n1 2 3 4 5\n2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7\nEach single digit above corresponds to the example position with a value of 8 on the top-left tile. Because the full map is actually five times larger in both dimensions, that position appears a total of 25 times, once in each duplicated tile, with the values shown above.\n\nHere is the full

Your submarine can barely still fit, though; the main problem is that the walls of the cave are covered in chitons, and it would be best not to bump any of them.\n\nThe cavern is large, but has a very low ceiling, restricting your motion to two dimensions. The shape of the cavern resembles a square; a quick scan of chiton density produces a map of risk level throughout the cave (your puzzle input).

It would be nice if you could do some kind of thermal imaging so you could tell ahead of time which caves are too hot to safely enter.\n\nFortunately, the submarine seems to be equipped with a thermal camera! When you activate it, you are greeted with:\n\nCongratulations on your purchase! To activate this infrared thermal imaging\ncamera system, please enter the code found on page 1 of the manual.\nApparently, the Elves have never used this feature. To your surprise, you manage to find the manual; as you go to open it, page 1 falls out. It's a large sheet of transparent paper! The transparent paper is marked with random dots and includes instructions on how to fold it up (your puzzle input). For example:\n\n6,10\n0,14\n9,10\n0,3\n10,4\n4,11\n6,0\n6,12\n4,1\n0,13\n10,12\n3,4\n3,0\n8,4\n1,10\n2,14\n8,10\n9,0\n\nfold along y=7\nfold along x=5\nThe first section is a list of dots on the transparent paper. 0,0 represents the top-left coordinate. The first value, x, increases to the right. The second value, y, increases downward. So, the coordinate 3,0 is to the right of 0,0, and the coordinate 0,7 is below 0,0. The coordinates in this example form the following pattern, where # is a dot on the paper and . is an empty, unmarked position:\n\n...#..#..#.\n....#......\n...........\n#..........\n...#....#.#\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n.#....#.##.\n....#......\n......#...#\n#..........\n#.#........\nThen, there is a list of fold instructions. Each instruction indicates a line on the transparent paper and wants you to fold the paper up (for horizontal y=... lines) or left (for vertical x=... lines). In this example, the first fold instruction is fold along y=7, which designates the line formed by all of the positions where y is 7 (marked here with -):\n\n...#..#..#.\n....#......\n...........\n#..........\n...#....#.#\n...........\n...........\n-----------\n...........\n...........\n.#....#.##.\n....#......\n......#...#\n#..........\n#.#........\nBecause this is a horizontal line, fold the bottom half up. Some of the dots might end up overlapping after the fold is complete, but dots will never appear exactly on a fold line. The result of doing this fold looks like this:\n\n#.##..#..#.\n#...#......\n......#...#\n#...#......\n.#.#..#.###\n...........\n...........\nNow, only 17 dots are visible.\n\nNotice, for example, the two dots in the bottom left corner before the transparent paper is folded; after the fold is complete, those dots appear in the top left corner (at 0,0 and 0,1). Because the paper is transparent, the dot just below them in the result (at 0,3) remains visible, as it can be seen through the transparent paper.\n\nAlso notice that some dots can end up overlapping; in this case, the dots merge together and become a single dot.\n\nThe second fold instruction is fold along x=5, which indicates this line:\n\n#.##.|#..#.\n#...#|.....\n.....|#...#\n#...#|.....\n.#.#.|#.###\n.....|.....\n.....|.....\nBecause this is a vertical line, fold left:\n\n#####\n#...#\n#...#\n#...#\n#####\n.....\n.....\nThe instructions made a square!\n\nThe transparent paper is pretty big, so for now, focus on just completing the first fold. After the first fold in the example above, 17 dots are visible - dots that end up overlapping after the fold is completed count as a single dot.\n\nHow many dots are visible after completing just the first fold instruction on your transparent paper?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nconst Point = struct {\n    x: u16,\n    y: u16,\n};\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);\n    defer arena.deinit();\n    const allocator = arena.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var points = std.AutoHashMap(Point, void).init(allocator);\n    defer points.deinit();\n\n    var buf_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n\n    var buf: [64]u8 = undefined;\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |line| {\n        if (line.len == 0) break;\n        var it = std.mem.split(u8, line, \",\");\n        const x = try std.fmt.parseUnsigned(u16, it.next().?, 10);\n        const y = try std.fmt.parseUnsigned(u16, it.next().?, 10);\n        try points.put(Point{ .x = x, .y = y }, {});\n    }\n\n    if (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |fold_line| {\n        var it = std.mem.split(u8, fold_line, \"=\");\n        _ = it.next();\n        const value = try std.fmt.parseUnsigned(u16, it.next().?, 10);\n\n        var new_points = std.AutoHashMap(Point, void).init(allocator);\n        var it_points = points.keyIterator();\n        while (it_points.next()) |point| {\n            var new_point = point.*;\n            if (fold_line[11] == 'x' and point.x > value) {\n                new_point.x = 2 * value - point.x;\n            } else if (fold_line[11] == 'y' and point.y > value) {\n                new_point.y = 2 * value - point.y;\n            }\n            try new_points.put(new_point, {});\n        }\n\n        const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n        try stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{new_points.count()});\n    }\n}\n```\n"}]}

The damage is worse than you thought. You bring up a copy of the navigation subsystem (your puzzle input).\n\nThe navigation subsystem syntax is made of several lines containing chunks. There are one or more chunks on each line, and chunks contain zero or more other chunks. Adjacent chunks are not separated by any delimiter; if one chunk stops, the next chunk (if any) can immediately start. Every chunk must open and close with one of four legal pairs of matching characters:\n\nIf a chunk opens with (, it must close with ).\nIf a chunk opens with [, it must close with ].\nIf a chunk opens with {, it must close with }.\nIf a chunk opens with <, it must close with >.\nSo, () is a legal chunk that contains no other chunks, as is []. More complex but valid chunks include ([]), {()()()}, <([{}])>, [<>({}){}[([])<>]], and even (((((((((()))))))))).\n\nSome lines are incomplete, but others are corrupted. Find and discard the corrupted lines first.\n\nA corrupted line is one where a chunk closes with the wrong character - that is, where the characters it opens and closes with do not form one of the four legal pairs listed above.\n\nExamples of corrupted chunks include (], {()()()>, (((()))}, and <([]){()}[{}]). Such a chunk can appear anywhere within a line, and its presence causes the whole line to be considered corrupted.\n\nFor example, consider the following navigation subsystem:\n\n[({(<(())[]>[[{[]{<()<>>\n[(()[<>])]({[<{<<[]>>(\n{([(<{}[<>[]}>{[]{[(<()>\n(((({<>}<{<{<>}{[]{[]{}\n[[<[([]))<([[{}[[()]]]\n[{[{({}]{}}([{[{{{}}([]\n{<[[]]>}<{[{[{[]{()[[[]\n[<(<(<(<{}))><([]([]()\n<{([([[(<>()){}]>(<<{{\n<{([{{}}[<[[[<>{}]]]>[]]\nSome of the lines aren't corrupted, just incomplete; you can ignore these lines for now. The remaining five lines are corrupted:\n\n{([(<{}[<>[]}>{[]{[(<()> - Expected ], but found } instead.\n[[<[([]))<([[{}[[()]]] - Expected ], but found ) instead.\n[{[{({}]{}}([{[{{{}}([] - Expected ), but found ] instead.\n[<(<(<(<{}))><([]([]() - Expected >, but found ) instead.\n<{([([[(<>()){}]>(<<{{ - Expected ], but found > instead.\nStop at the first incorrect closing character on each corrupted line.\n\nDid you know that syntax checkers actually have contests to see who can get the high score for syntax errors in a file? It's true! To calculate the syntax error score for a line, take the first illegal character on the line and look it up in the following table:\n\n): 3 points.\n]: 57 points.\n}: 1197 points.\n>: 25137 points.\nIn the above example, an illegal ) was found twice (2*3 = 6 points), an illegal ] was found once (57 points), an illegal } was found once (1197 points), and an illegal > was found once (25137 points). So, the total syntax error score for this file is 6+57+1197+25137 = 26397 points!\n\nFind the first illegal character in each corrupted line of the navigation subsystem.

Parts are even still volcanically active; small hydrothermal vents release smoke into the caves that slowly settles like rain.\n\nIf you can model how the smoke flows through the caves, you might be able to avoid it and be that much safer. The submarine generates a heightmap of the floor of the nearby caves for you (your puzzle input).\n\nSmoke flows to the lowest point of the area it's in. For example, consider the following heightmap:\n\n2199943210\n3987894921\n9856789892\n8767896789\n9899965678\nEach number corresponds to the height of a particular location, where 9 is the highest and 0 is the lowest a location can be.\n\nYour first goal is to find the low points - the locations that are lower than any of its adjacent locations. Most locations have four adjacent locations (up, down, left, and right); locations on the edge or corner of the map have three or two adjacent locations, respectively. (Diagonal locations do not count as adjacent.)\n\nIn the above example, there are four low points, all highlighted: two are in the first row (a 1 and a 0), one is in the third row (a 5), and one is in the bottom row (also a 5). All other locations on the heightmap have some lower adjacent location, and so are not low points.\n\nThe risk level of a low point is 1 plus its height. In the above example, the risk levels of the low points are 2, 1, 6, and 6.

Sensors indicate another exit to this cave at a much greater depth, so you have no choice but to press on.\n\nAs your submarine slowly makes its way through the cave system, you notice that the four-digit seven-segment displays in your submarine are malfunctioning; they must have been damaged during the escape. You'll be in a lot of trouble without them, so you'd better figure out what's wrong.\n\nEach digit of a seven-segment display is rendered by turning on or off any of seven segments named a through g:\n\n  0:      1:      2:      3:      4:\n aaaa    ....    aaaa    aaaa    ....\nb    c  .    c  .    c  .    c  b    c\nb    c  .    c  .    c  .    c  b    c\n ....    ....    dddd    dddd    dddd\ne    f  .    f  e    .  .    f  .    f\ne    f  .    f  e    .  .    f  .    f\n gggg    ....    gggg    gggg    ....\n\n  5:      6:      7:      8:      9:\n aaaa    aaaa    aaaa    aaaa    aaaa\nb    .  b    .  .    c  b    c  b    c\nb    .  b    .  .    c  b    c  b    c\n dddd    dddd    ....    dddd    dddd\n.    f  e    f  .    f  e    f  .    f\n.    f  e    f  .    f  e    f  .    f\n gggg    gggg    ....    gggg    gggg\nSo, to render a 1, only segments c and f would be turned on; the rest would be off. To render a 7, only segments a, c, and f would be turned on.\n\nThe problem is that the signals which control the segments have been mixed up on each display. The submarine is still trying to display numbers by producing output on signal wires a through g, but those wires are connected to segments randomly. Worse, the wire/segment connections are mixed up separately for each four-digit display! (All of the digits within a display use the same connections, though.)\n\nSo, you might know that only signal wires b and g are turned on, but that doesn't mean segments b and g are turned on: the only digit that uses two segments is 1, so it must mean segments c and f are meant to be on. With just that information, you still can't tell which wire (b/g) goes to which segment (c/f). For that, you'll need to collect more information.\n\nFor each display, you watch the changing signals for a while, make a note of all ten unique signal patterns you see, and then write down a single four digit output value (your puzzle input). Using the signal patterns, you should be able to work out which pattern corresponds to which digit.\n\nFor example, here is what you might see in a single entry in your notes:\n\nacedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab |\ncdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf\n(The entry is wrapped here to two lines so it fits; in your notes, it will all be on a single line.)\n\nEach entry consists of ten unique signal patterns, a | delimiter, and finally the four digit output value. Within an entry, the same wire/segment connections are used (but you don't know what the connections actually are). The unique signal patterns correspond to the ten different ways the submarine tries to render a digit using the current wire/segment connections. Because 7 is the only digit that uses three segments, dab in the above example means that to render a 7, signal lines d, a, and b are on. Because 4 is the only digit that uses four segments, eafb means that to render a 4, signal lines e, a, f, and b are on.\n\nUsing this information, you should be able to work out which combination of signal wires corresponds to each of the ten digits. Then, you can decode the four digit output value. Unfortunately, in the above example, all of the digits in the output value (cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf) use five segments and are more difficult to deduce.\n\nFor now, focus on the easy digits. Consider this larger example:\n\nbe cfbegad cbdgef fgaecd cgeb fdcge agebfd fecdb fabcd edb |\nfdgacbe cefdb cefbgd gcbe\nedbfga begcd cbg gc gcadebf fbgde acbgfd abcde gfcbed gfec |\nfcgedb cgb dgebacf gc\nfgaebd cg bdaec gdafb agbcfd gdcbef bgcad gfac gcb cdgabef |\ncg cg fdcagb cbg\nfbegcd cbd adcefb dageb afcb bc aefdc ecdab fgdeca fcdbega |\nefabcd cedba gadfec cb\naecbfdg fbg gf bafeg dbefa fcge gcbea fcaegb dgceab fcbdga |\ngecf egdcabf bgf bfgea\nfgeab ca afcebg bdacfeg cfaedg gcfdb baec bfadeg bafgc acf |\ngebdcfa ecba ca fadegcb\ndbcfg fgd bdegcaf fgec aegbdf ecdfab fbedc dacgb gdcebf gf |\ncefg dcbef fcge gbcadfe\nbdfegc cbegaf gecbf dfcage bdacg ed bedf ced adcbefg gebcd |\ned bcgafe cdgba cbgef\negadfb cdbfeg cegd fecab cgb gbdefca cg fgcdab egfdb bfceg |\ngbdfcae bgc cg cgb\ngcafb gcf dcaebfg ecagb gf abcdeg gaef cafbge fdbac fegbdc |\nfgae cfgab fg bagce\nBecause the digits 1, 4, 7, and 8 each use a unique number of segments, you should be able to tell which combinations of signals correspond to those digits. Counting only digits in the output values (the part after | on each line), in the above example, there are 26 instances of digits that use a unique number of segments (highlighted above).\n\nIn the output values, how many times do digits 1, 4, 7, or 8 appear?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var buf_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n\n    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    var count: usize = 0;\n\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |line| {\n        var it = std.mem.split(u8, line, \" | \");\n        _ = it.next();\n        if (it.next()) |output| {\n            var digit_it = std.mem.split(u8, output, \" \");\n            while (digit_it.next()) |digit| {\n                switch (digit.len) {\n                    2, 3, 4, 7 => count += 1,\n                    else => {},\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{count});\n}\n```\n"}]}

What you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.\n\nMaybe it wants to play bingo?\n\nBingo is played on a set of boards each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers. Numbers are chosen at random, and the chosen number is marked on all boards on which it appears. (Numbers may not appear on all boards.) If all numbers in any row or any column of a board are marked, that board wins. (Diagonals don't count.)\n\nThe submarine has a bingo subsystem to help passengers (currently, you and the giant squid) pass the time. It automatically generates a random order in which to draw numbers and a random set of boards (your puzzle input). For example:\n\n7,4,9,5,11,17,23,2,0,14,21,24,10,16,13,6,15,25,12,22,18,20,8,19,3,26,1\n\n22 13 17 11  0\n 8  2 23  4 24\n21  9 14 16  7\n 6 10  3 18  5\n 1 12 20 15 19\n\n 3 15  0  2 22\n 9 18 13 17  5\n19  8  7 25 23\n20 11 10 24  4\n14 21 16 12  6\n\n14 21 17 24  4\n10 16 15  9 19\n18  8 23 26 20\n22 11 13  6  5\n 2  0 12  3  7\nAfter the first five numbers are drawn (7, 4, 9, 5, and 11), there are no winners, but the boards are marked as follows (shown here adjacent to each other to save space):\n\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\nAfter the next six numbers are drawn (17, 23, 2, 0, 14, and 21), there are still no winners:\n\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\nFinally, 24 is drawn:\n\n22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4\n 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19\n21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20\n 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5\n 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7\nAt this point, the third board wins because it has at least one complete row or column of marked numbers (in this case, the entire top row is marked: 14 21 17 24 4).\n\nThe score of the winning board can now be calculated. Start by finding the sum of all unmarked numbers on that board; in this case, the sum is 188. Then, multiply that sum by the number that was just called when the board won, 24, to get the final score, 188 * 24 = 4512.\n\nTo guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which board will win first. What will your final score be if you choose that board?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 27027.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nOn the other hand, it might be wise to try a different strategy: let the giant squid win.\n\nYou aren't sure how many bingo boards a giant squid could play at once, so rather than waste time counting its arms, the safe thing to do is to figure out which board will win last and choose that one.

You make your way to the resort.\n\nAs you enter the lobby, you discover a small problem: the floor is being renovated. You can't even reach the check-in desk until they've finished installing the new tile floor.\n\nThe tiles are all hexagonal; they need to be arranged in a hex grid with a very specific color pattern. Not in the mood to wait, you offer to help figure out the pattern.\n\nThe tiles are all white on one side and black on the other. They start with the white side facing up. The lobby is large enough to fit whatever pattern might need to appear there.\n\nA member of the renovation crew gives you a list of the tiles that need to be flipped over (your puzzle input). Each line in the list identifies a single tile that needs to be flipped by giving a series of steps starting from a reference tile in the very center of the room. (Every line starts from the same reference tile.)\n\nBecause the tiles are hexagonal, every tile has six neighbors: east, southeast, southwest, west, northwest, and northeast. These directions are given in your list, respectively, as e, se, sw, w, nw, and ne. A tile is identified by a series of these directions with no delimiters; for example, esenee identifies the tile you land on if you start at the reference tile and then move one tile east, one tile southeast, one tile northeast, and one tile east.\n\nEach time a tile is identified, it flips from white to black or from black to white. Tiles might be flipped more than once. For example, a line like esew flips a tile immediately adjacent to the reference tile, and a line like nwwswee flips the reference tile itself.\n\nHere is a larger example:\n\nsesenwnenenewseeswwswswwnenewsewsw\nneeenesenwnwwswnenewnwwsewnenwseswesw\nseswneswswsenwwnwse\nnwnwneseeswswnenewneswwnewseswneseene\nswweswneswnenwsewnwneneseenw\neesenwseswswnenwswnwnwsewwnwsene\nsewnenenenesenwsewnenwwwse\nwenwwweseeeweswwwnwwe\nwsweesenenewnwwnwsenewsenwwsesesenwne\nneeswseenwwswnwswswnw\nnenwswwsewswnenenewsenwsenwnesesenew\nenewnwewneswsewnwswenweswnenwsenwsw\nsweneswneswneneenwnewenewwneswswnese\nswwesenesewenwneswnwwneseswwne\nenesenwswwswneneswsenwnewswseenwsese\nwnwnesenesenenwwnenwsewesewsesesew\nnenewswnwewswnenesenwnesewesw\neneswnwswnwsenenwnwnwwseeswneewsenese\nneswnwewnwnwseenwseesewsenwsweewe\nwseweeenwnesenwwwswnew\nIn the above example, 10 tiles are flipped once (to black), and 5 more are flipped twice (to black, then back to white).

The crab is going to mix up some cups, and you have to predict where they'll end up.\n\nThe cups will be arranged in a circle and labeled clockwise (your puzzle input). For example, if your labeling were 32415, there would be five cups in the circle; going clockwise around the circle from the first cup, the cups would be labeled 3, 2, 4, 1, 5, and then back to 3 again.\n\nBefore the crab starts, it will designate the first cup in your list as the current cup. The crab is then going to do 100 moves.\n\nEach move, the crab does the following actions:\n\nThe crab picks up the three cups that are immediately clockwise of the current cup. They are removed from the circle; cup spacing is adjusted as necessary to maintain the circle.\nThe crab selects a destination cup: the cup with a label equal to the current cup's label minus one. If this would select one of the cups that was just picked up, the crab will keep subtracting one until it finds a cup that wasn't just picked up. If at any point in this process the value goes below the lowest value on any cup's label, it wraps around to the highest value on any cup's label instead.\nThe crab places the cups it just picked up so that they are immediately clockwise of the destination cup. They keep the same order as when they were picked up.\nThe crab selects a new current cup: the cup which is immediately clockwise of the current cup.\nFor example, suppose your cup labeling were 389125467. If the crab were to do merely 10 moves, the following changes would occur:\n\n-- move 1 --\ncups: (3) 8  9  1  2  5  4  6  7 \npick up: 8, 9, 1\ndestination: 2\n\n-- move 2 --\ncups:  3 (2) 8  9  1  5  4  6  7 \npick up: 8, 9, 1\ndestination: 7\n\n-- move 3 --\ncups:  3  2 (5) 4  6  7  8  9  1 \npick up: 4, 6, 7\ndestination: 3\n\n-- move 4 --\ncups:  7  2  5 (8) 9  1  3  4  6 \npick up: 9, 1, 3\ndestination: 7\n\n-- move 5 --\ncups:  3  2  5  8 (4) 6  7  9  1 \npick up: 6, 7, 9\ndestination: 3\n\n-- move 6 --\ncups:  9  2  5  8  4 (1) 3  6  7 \npick up: 3, 6, 7\ndestination: 9\n\n-- move 7 --\ncups:  7  2  5  8  4  1 (9) 3  6 \npick up: 3, 6, 7\ndestination: 8\n\n-- move 8 --\ncups:  8  3  6  7  4  1  9 (2) 5 \npick up: 5, 8, 3\ndestination: 1\n\n-- move 9 --\ncups:  7  4  1  5  8  3  9  2 (6)\npick up: 7, 4, 1\ndestination: 5\n\n-- move 10 --\ncups: (5) 7  4  1  8  3  9  2  6 \npick up: 7, 4, 1\ndestination: 3\n\n-- final --\ncups:  5 (8) 3  7  4  1  9  2  6 \nIn the above example, the cups' values are the labels as they appear moving clockwise around the circle; the current cup is marked with ( ).\n\nAfter the crab is done, what order will the cups be in? Starting after the cup labeled 1, collect the other cups' labels clockwise into a single string with no extra characters; each number except 1 should appear exactly once. In the above example, after 10 moves, the cups clockwise from 1 are labeled 9, 2, 6, 5, and so on, producing 92658374. If the crab were to complete all 100 moves, the order after cup 1 would be 67384529.\n\nUsing your labeling, simulate 100 moves. What are the labels on the cups after cup 1?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    const input = try file.readToEndAlloc(allocator, 1024);\n    defer allocator.free(input);\n\n    var cups = try allocator.alloc(usize, input.len + 1);\n    defer allocator.free(cups);\n\n    var current_cup: usize = 0;\n    for (input, 0..) |char, i| {\n        const cup = char - '0';\n        if (i == 0) current_cup = cup;\n        if (i < input.len - 1) {\n            cups[cup] = input[i + 1] - '0';\n        }\n    }\n    cups[input[input.len - 1] - '0'] = input[0] - '0';\n\n    var i: usize = 0;\n    while (i < 100) : (i += 1) {\n        const pickup1 = cups[current_cup];\n        const pickup2 = cups[pickup1];\n        const pickup3 = cups[pickup2];\n\n        cups[current_cup] = cups[pickup3];\n\n        var destination_cup: usize = if (current_cup > 1) current_cup - 1 else input.len;\n        while (destination_cup == pickup1 or destination_cup == pickup2 or destination_cup == pickup3) {\n            destination_cup = if (destination_cup > 1) destination_cup - 1 else input.len;\n        }\n\n        cups[pickup3] = cups[destination_cup];\n        cups[destination_cup] = pickup1;\n\n        current_cup = cups[current_cup];\n    }\n\n    var cup = cups[1];\n    while (cup != 1) {\n        try std.io.getStdOut().writer().print(\"{d}\", .{cup});\n        cup = cups[cup];\n    }\n    try std.io.getStdOut().writer().print(\"\\n\", .{});\n}\n```\n"}]}

They're curious if you could help them with their math homework.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like this \"math\" follows different rules than you remember.\n\nThe homework (your puzzle input) consists of a series of expressions that consist of addition (+), multiplication (*), and parentheses ((...)). Just like normal math, parentheses indicate that the expression inside must be evaluated before it can be used by the surrounding expression. Addition still finds the sum of the numbers on both sides of the operator, and multiplication still finds the product.\n\nHowever, the rules of operator precedence have changed. Rather than evaluating multiplication before addition, the operators have the same precedence, and are evaluated left-to-right regardless of the order in which they appear.\n\nFor example, the steps to evaluate the expression 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 are as follows:\n\n1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6\n  3   * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6\n      9   + 4 * 5 + 6\n         13   * 5 + 6\n             65   + 6\n                 71\nParentheses can override this order; for example, here is what happens if parentheses are added to form 1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 + 6)):\n\n1 + (2 * 3) + (4 * (5 + 6))\n1 +    6    + (4 * (5 + 6))\n     7      + (4 * (5 + 6))\n     7      + (4 *   11   )\n     7      +     44\n            51\nHere are a few more examples:\n\n2 * 3 + (4 * 5) becomes 26.\n5 + (8 * 3 + 9 + 3 * 4 * 3) becomes 437.\n5 * 9 * (7 * 3 * 3 + 9 * 3 + (8 + 6 * 4)) becomes 12240.\n((2 + 4 * 9) * (6 + 9 * 8 + 6) + 6) + 2 + 4 * 2 becomes 13632.\nBefore you can help with the homework, you need to understand it yourself.

However, the train ticket you were given is in a language you don't understand. You should probably figure out what it says before you get to the train station after the next flight.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't actually read the words on the ticket. You can, however, read the numbers, and so you figure out the fields these tickets must have and the valid ranges for values in those fields.\n\nYou collect the rules for ticket fields, the numbers on your ticket, and the numbers on other nearby tickets for the same train service (via the airport security cameras) together into a single document you can reference (your puzzle input).\n\nThe rules for ticket fields specify a list of fields that exist somewhere on the ticket and the valid ranges of values for each field. For example, a rule like class: 1-3 or 5-7 means that one of the fields in every ticket is named class and can be any value in the ranges 1-3 or 5-7 (inclusive, such that 3 and 5 are both valid in this field, but 4 is not).\n\nEach ticket is represented by a single line of comma-separated values. The values are the numbers on the ticket in the order they appear; every ticket has the same format. For example, consider this ticket:\n\n.--------------------------------------------------------.\n| ????: 101    ?????: 102   ??????????: 103     ???: 104 |\n|                                                        |\n| ??: 301  ??: 302             ???????: 303      ??????? |\n| ??: 401  ??: 402           ???? ????: 403    ????????? |\n'--------------------------------------------------------'\nHere, ? represents text in a language you don't understand. This ticket might be represented as 101,102,103,104,301,302,303,401,402,403; of course, the actual train tickets you're looking at are much more complicated. In any case, you've extracted just the numbers in such a way that the first number is always the same specific field, the second number is always a different specific field, and so on - you just don't know what each position actually means!\n\nStart by determining which tickets are completely invalid; these are tickets that contain values which aren't valid for any field. Ignore your ticket for now.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following notes:\n\nclass: 1-3 or 5-7\nrow: 6-11 or 33-44\nseat: 13-40 or 45-50\n\nyour ticket:\n7,1,14\n\nnearby tickets:\n7,3,47\n40,4,50\n55,2,20\n38,6,12\nIt doesn't matter which position corresponds to which field; you can identify invalid nearby tickets by considering only whether tickets contain values that are not valid for any field. In this example, the values on the first nearby ticket are all valid for at least one field. This is not true of the other three nearby tickets: the values 4, 55, and 12 are are not valid for any field. Adding together all of the invalid values produces your ticket scanning error rate: 4 + 55 + 12 = 71.\n\nConsider the validity of the nearby tickets you scanned.

They're playing a memory game and are ever so excited to explain the rules!\n\nIn this game, the players take turns saying numbers. They begin by taking turns reading from a list of starting numbers (your puzzle input). Then, each turn consists of considering the most recently spoken number:\n\nIf that was the first time the number has been spoken, the current player says 0.\nOtherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces how many turns apart the number is from when it was previously spoken.\nSo, after the starting numbers, each turn results in that player speaking aloud either 0 (if the last number is new) or an age (if the last number is a repeat).\n\nFor example, suppose the starting numbers are 0,3,6:\n\nTurn 1: The 1st number spoken is a starting number, 0.\nTurn 2: The 2nd number spoken is a starting number, 3.\nTurn 3: The 3rd number spoken is a starting number, 6.\nTurn 4: Now, consider the last number spoken, 6. Since that was the first time the number had been spoken, the 4th number spoken is 0.\nTurn 5: Next, again consider the last number spoken, 0. Since it had been spoken before, the next number to speak is the difference between the turn number when it was last spoken (the previous turn, 4) and the turn number of the time it was most recently spoken before then (turn 1). Thus, the 5th number spoken is 4 - 1, 3.\nTurn 6: The last number spoken, 3 had also been spoken before, most recently on turns 5 and 2. So, the 6th number spoken is 5 - 2, 3.\nTurn 7: Since 3 was just spoken twice in a row, and the last two turns are 1 turn apart, the 7th number spoken is 1.\nTurn 8: Since 1 is new, the 8th number spoken is 0.\nTurn 9: 0 was last spoken on turns 8 and 4, so the 9th number spoken is the difference between them, 4.\nTurn 10: 4 is new, so the 10th number spoken is 0.\n(The game ends when the Elves get sick of playing or dinner is ready, whichever comes first.)\n\nTheir question for you is: what will be the 2020th number spoken?

Due to the storm, all direct flights have been cancelled, but a route is available to get around the storm. You take it.\n\nWhile you wait for your flight, you decide to check in with the Elves back at the North Pole. They're playing a memory game and are ever so excited to explain the rules!\n\nIn this game, the players take turns saying numbers. They begin by taking turns reading from a list of starting numbers (your puzzle input). Then, each turn consists of considering the most recently spoken number:\n\nIf that was the first time the number has been spoken, the current player says 0.\nOtherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces how many turns apart the number is from when it was previously spoken.\nSo, after the starting numbers, each turn results in that player speaking aloud either 0 (if the last number is new) or an age (if the last number is a repeat).\n\nFor example, suppose the starting numbers are 0,3,6:\n\nTurn 1: The 1st number spoken is a starting number, 0.\nTurn 2: The 2nd number spoken is a starting number, 3.\nTurn 3: The 3rd number spoken is a starting number, 6.\nTurn 4: Now, consider the last number spoken, 6. Since that was the first time the number had been spoken, the 4th number spoken is 0.\nTurn 5: Next, again consider the last number spoken, 0. Since it had been spoken before, the next number to speak is the difference between the turn number when it was last spoken (the previous turn, 4) and the turn number of the time it was most recently spoken before then (turn 1). Thus, the 5th number spoken is 4 - 1, 3.\nTurn 6: The last number spoken, 3 had also been spoken before, most recently on turns 5 and 2. So, the 6th number spoken is 5 - 2, 3.\nTurn 7: Since 3 was just spoken twice in a row, and the last two turns are 1 turn apart, the 7th number spoken is 1.\nTurn 8: Since 1 is new, the 8th number spoken is 0.\nTurn 9: 0 was last spoken on turns 8 and 4, so the 9th number spoken is the difference between them, 4.\nTurn 10: 4 is new, so the 10th number spoken is 0.\n(The game ends when the Elves get sick of playing or dinner is ready, whichever comes first.)\n\nTheir question for you is: what will be the 2020th number spoken?

The ferry needs to take evasive actions!\n\nUnfortunately, the ship's navigation computer seems to be malfunctioning; rather than giving a route directly to safety, it produced extremely circuitous instructions. When the captain uses the PA system to ask if anyone can help, you quickly volunteer.\n\nThe navigation instructions (your puzzle input) consists of a sequence of single-character actions paired with integer input values. After staring at them for a few minutes, you work out what they probably mean:\n\nAction N means to move north by the given value.\nAction S means to move south by the given value.\nAction E means to move east by the given value.\nAction W means to move west by the given value.\nAction L means to turn left the given number of degrees.\nAction R means to turn right the given number of degrees.\nAction F means to move forward by the given value in the direction the ship is currently facing.\nThe ship starts by facing east. Only the L and R actions change the direction the ship is facing. (That is, if the ship is facing east and the next instruction is N10, the ship would move north 10 units, but would still move east if the following action were F.)\n\nFor example:\n\nF10\nN3\nF7\nR90\nF11\nThese instructions would be handled as follows:\n\nF10 would move the ship 10 units east (because the ship starts by facing east) to east 10, north 0.\nN3 would move the ship 3 units north to east 10, north 3.\nF7 would move the ship another 7 units east (because the ship is still facing east) to east 17, north 3.\nR90 would cause the ship to turn right by 90 degrees and face south; it remains at east 17, north 3.\nF11 would move the ship 11 units south to east 17, south 8.\nAt the end of these instructions, the ship's Manhattan distance (sum of the absolute values of its east/west position and its north/south position) from its starting position is 17 + 8 = 25.\n\nFigure out where the navigation instructions lead. What is the Manhattan distance between that location and the ship's starting position?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 381.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nBefore you can give the destination to the captain, you realize that the actual action meanings were printed on the back of the instructions the whole time.\n\nAlmost all of the actions indicate how to move a waypoint which is relative to the ship's position:\n\nAction N means to move the waypoint north by the given value.\nAction S means to move the waypoint south by the given value.\nAction E means to move the waypoint east by the given value.\nAction W means to move the waypoint west by the given value.\nAction L means to rotate the waypoint around the ship left (counter-clockwise) the given number of degrees.\nAction R means to rotate the waypoint around the ship right (clockwise) the given number of degrees.\nAction F means to move forward to the waypoint a number of times equal to the given value.\nThe waypoint starts 10 units east and 1 unit north relative to the ship. The waypoint is relative to the ship; that is, if the ship moves, the waypoint moves with it.\n\nFor example, using the same instructions as above:\n\nF10 moves the ship to the waypoint 10 times (a total of 100 units east and 10 units north), leaving the ship at east 100, north 10. The waypoint stays 10 units east and 1 unit north of the ship.\nN3 moves the waypoint 3 units north to 10 units east and 4 units north of the ship. The ship remains at east 100, north 10.\nF7 moves the ship to the waypoint 7 times (a total of 70 units east and 28 units north), leaving the ship at east 170, north 38. The waypoint stays 10 units east and 4 units north of the ship.\nR90 rotates the waypoint around the ship clockwise 90 degrees, moving it to 4 units east and 10 units south of the ship. The ship remains at east 170, north 38.\nF11 moves the ship to the waypoint 11 times (a total of 44 units east and 110 units south), leaving the ship at east 214, south 72. The waypoint stays 4 units east and 10 units south of the ship.\nAfter these operations, the ship's Manhattan distance from its starting position is 214 + 72 = 286.\n\nFigure out where the navigation instructions actually lead.

You aren't sure which seat is yours, and all of the flight attendants are busy with the flood of people that suddenly made it through passport control.\n\nYou write a quick program to use your phone's camera to scan all of the nearby boarding passes (your puzzle input); perhaps you can find your seat through process of elimination.\n\nInstead of zones or groups, this airline uses binary space partitioning to seat people. A seat might be specified like FBFBBFFRLR, where F means \"front\", B means \"back\", L means \"left\", and R means \"right\".\n\nThe first 7 characters will either be F or B; these specify exactly one of the 128 rows on the plane (numbered 0 through 127). Each letter tells you which half of a region the given seat is in. Start with the whole list of rows; the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the front (0 through 63) or the back (64 through 127). The next letter indicates which half of that region the seat is in, and so on until you're left with exactly one row.\n\nFor example, consider just the first seven characters of FBFBBFFRLR:\n\nStart by considering the whole range, rows 0 through 127.\nF means to take the lower half, keeping rows 0 through 63.\nB means to take the upper half, keeping rows 32 through 63.\nF means to take the lower half, keeping rows 32 through 47.\nB means to take the upper half, keeping rows 40 through 47.\nB keeps rows 44 through 47.\nF keeps rows 44 through 45.\nThe final F keeps the lower of the two, row 44.\nThe last three characters will be either L or R; these specify exactly one of the 8 columns of seats on the plane (numbered 0 through 7). The same process as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps. L means to keep the lower half, while R means to keep the upper half.\n\nFor example, consider just the last 3 characters of FBFBBFFRLR:\n\nStart by considering the whole range, columns 0 through 7.\nR means to take the upper half, keeping columns 4 through 7.\nL means to take the lower half, keeping columns 4 through 5.\nThe final R keeps the upper of the two, column 5.\nSo, decoding FBFBBFFRLR reveals that it is the seat at row 44, column 5.\n\nEvery seat also has a unique seat ID: multiply the row by 8, then add the column. In this example, the seat has ID 44 * 8 + 5 = 357.\n\nHere are some other boarding passes:\n\nBFFFBBFRRR: row 70, column 7, seat ID 567.\nFFFBBBFRRR: row 14, column 7, seat ID 119.\nBBFFBBFRLL: row 102, column 4, seat ID 820.\nAs a sanity check, look through your list of boarding passes.

While these documents are extremely similar, North Pole Credentials aren't issued by a country and therefore aren't actually valid documentation for travel in most of the world.\n\nIt seems like you're not the only one having problems, though; a very long line has formed for the automatic passport scanners, and the delay could upset your travel itinerary.\n\nDue to some questionable network security, you realize you might be able to solve both of these problems at the same time.\n\nThe automatic passport scanners are slow because they're having trouble detecting which passports have all required fields. The expected fields are as follows:\n\nbyr (Birth Year)\niyr (Issue Year)\neyr (Expiration Year)\nhgt (Height)\nhcl (Hair Color)\necl (Eye Color)\npid (Passport ID)\ncid (Country ID)\nPassport data is validated in batch files (your puzzle input). Each passport is represented as a sequence of key:value pairs separated by spaces or newlines. Passports are separated by blank lines.\n\nHere is an example batch file containing four passports:\n\necl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd\nbyr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm\n\niyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884\nhcl:#cfa07d byr:1929\n\nhcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013\neyr:2024\necl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931\nhgt:179cm\n\nhcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648\niyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in\nThe first passport is valid - all eight fields are present. The second passport is invalid - it is missing hgt (the Height field).\n\nThe third passport is interesting; the only missing field is cid, so it looks like data from North Pole Credentials, not a passport at all! Surely, nobody would mind if you made the system temporarily ignore missing cid fields. Treat this \"passport\" as valid.\n\nThe fourth passport is missing two fields, cid and byr. Missing cid is fine, but missing any other field is not, so this passport is invalid.\n\nAccording to the above rules, your improved system would report 2 valid passports.\n\nCount the number of valid passports - those that have all required fields. Treat cid as optional. In your batch file, how many passports are valid?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 226.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe line is moving more quickly now, but you overhear airport security talking about how passports with invalid data are getting through. Better add some data validation, quick!\n\nYou can continue to ignore the cid field, but each other field has strict rules about what values are valid for automatic validation:\n\nbyr (Birth Year) - four digits; at least 1920 and at most 2002.\niyr (Issue Year) - four digits; at least 2010 and at most 2020.\neyr (Expiration Year) - four digits; at least 2020 and at most 2030.\nhgt (Height) - a number followed by either cm or in:\nIf cm, the number must be at least 150 and at most 193.\nIf in, the number must be at least 59 and at most 76.\nhcl (Hair Color) - a # followed by exactly six characters 0-9 or a-f.\necl (Eye Color) - exactly one of: amb blu brn gry grn hzl oth.\npid (Passport ID) - a nine-digit number, including leading zeroes.\ncid (Country ID) - ignored, missing or not.\nYour job is to count the passports where all required fields are both present and valid according to the above rules. Here are some example values:\n\nbyr valid:   2002\nbyr invalid: 2003\n\nhgt valid:   60in\nhgt valid:   190cm\nhgt invalid: 190in\nhgt invalid: 190\n\nhcl valid:   #123abc\nhcl invalid: #123abz\nhcl invalid: 123abc\n\necl valid:   brn\necl invalid: wat\n\npid valid:   000000001\npid invalid: 0123456789\nHere are some invalid passports:\n\neyr:1972 cid:100\nhcl:#18171d ecl:amb hgt:170 pid:186cm iyr:2018 byr:1926\n\niyr:2019\nhcl:#602927 eyr:1967 hgt:170cm\necl:grn pid:012533040 byr:1946\n\nhcl:dab227 iyr:2012\necl:brn hgt:182cm pid:021572410 eyr:2020 byr:1992 cid:277\n\nhgt:59cm ecl:zzz\neyr:2038 hcl:74454a iyr:2023\npid:3556412378 byr:2007\nHere are some valid passports:\n\npid:087499704 hgt:74in ecl:grn iyr:2012 eyr:2030 byr:1980\nhcl:#623a2f\n\neyr:2029 ecl:blu cid:129 byr:1989\niyr:2014 pid:896056539 hcl:#a97842 hgt:165cm\n\nhcl:#888785\nhgt:164cm byr:2001 iyr:2015 cid:88\npid:545766238 ecl:hzl\neyr:2022\n\niyr:2010 hgt:158cm hcl:#b6652a ecl:blu byr:1944 eyr:2021 pid:093154719\nCount the number of valid passports - those that have all required fields and valid values.

For example:\n\n..##.......\n#...#...#..\n.#....#..#.\n..#.#...#.#\n.#...##..#.\n..#.##.....\n.#.#.#....#\n.#........#\n#.##...#...\n#...##....#\n.#..#...#.#\nThese aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to the right many times:\n\n..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->\n#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..\n.#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.\n..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#\n.#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.\n..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->\n.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#\n.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#\n#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...\n#...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#\n.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->\nYou start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).\n\nThe toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:\n\nFrom your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.\n\nThe locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree:\n\n..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->\n#..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..\n.#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.\n..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#\n.#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.\n..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->\n.#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#\n.#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#\n#.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...\n#...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....#\n.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->\nIn this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.\n\nStarting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 171.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nTime to check the rest of the slopes - you need to minimize the probability of a sudden arboreal stop, after all.\n\nDetermine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:\n\nRight 1, down 1.\nRight 3, down 1.

The Elf responsible for the rover takes a picture of the password (your puzzle input) and sends it to you via the Digital Sending Network.\n\nUnfortunately, images sent via the Digital Sending Network aren't encoded with any normal encoding; instead, they're encoded in a special Space Image Format. None of the Elves seem to remember why this is the case. They send you the instructions to decode it.\n\nImages are sent as a series of digits that each represent the color of a single pixel. The digits fill each row of the image left-to-right, then move downward to the next row, filling rows top-to-bottom until every pixel of the image is filled.\n\nEach image actually consists of a series of identically-sized layers that are filled in this way. So, the first digit corresponds to the top-left pixel of the first layer, the second digit corresponds to the pixel to the right of that on the same layer, and so on until the last digit, which corresponds to the bottom-right pixel of the last layer.\n\nFor example, given an image 3 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall, the image data 123456789012 corresponds to the following image layers:\n\nLayer 1: 123\n         456\n\nLayer 2: 789\n         012\nThe image you received is 25 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall.\n\nTo make sure the image wasn't corrupted during transmission, the Elves would like you to find the layer that contains the fewest 0 digits.

On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: \"Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--\" The ship computer bursts into flames.\n\nYou notify the Elves that the computer's magic smoke seems to have escaped. \"That computer ran Intcode programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!\"\n\nAn Intcode program is a list of integers separated by commas (like 1,0,0,3,99). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position 0). Here, you will find an opcode - either 1, 2, or 99. The opcode indicates what to do; for example, 99 means that the program is finished and should immediately halt. Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.\n\nOpcode 1 adds together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.\n\nFor example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.\n\nOpcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.\n\nOnce you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following program:\n\n1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50\nFor the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:\n\n1,9,10,3,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nThe first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the output (3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:\n\n1,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStep forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively. Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:\n\n3500,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode 99, halting the program.\n\nHere are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:\n\n1,0,0,0,99 becomes 2,0,0,0,99 (1 + 1 = 2).\n2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,6,99 (3 * 2 = 6).\n2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,9801 (99 * 99 = 9801).\n1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99 becomes 30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99.\nOnce you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity assist program (your puzzle input) to the \"1202 program alarm\" state it had just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the value 2. What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 4714701.\n\n--- Part Two ---\n\"Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly! Keep it nearby during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what they are as you need them.\"\n\n\"However, your current priority should be to complete your gravity assist around the Moon. For this mission to succeed, we should settle on some terminology for the parts you've already built.\"\n\nIntcode programs are given as a list of integers; these values are used as the initial state for the computer's memory. When you run an Intcode program, make sure to start by initializing memory to the program's values. A position in memory is called an address (for example, the first value in memory is at \"address 0\").\n\nOpcodes (like 1, 2, or 99) mark the beginning of an instruction. The values used immediately after an opcode, if any, are called the instruction's parameters. For example, in the instruction 1,2,3,4, 1 is the opcode; 2, 3, and 4 are the parameters. The instruction 99 contains only an opcode and has no parameters.\n\nThe address of the current instruction is called the instruction pointer; it starts at 0. After an instruction finishes, the instruction pointer increases by the number of values in the instruction; until you add more instructions to the computer, this is always 4 (1 opcode + 3 parameters) for the add and multiply instructions. (The halt instruction would increase the instruction pointer by 1, but it halts the program instead.)\n\n\"With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the gravity assist, you need to determine what pair of inputs produces the output 19690720.\"\n\nThe inputs should still be provided to the program by replacing the values at addresses 1 and 2, just like before. In this program, the value placed in address 1 is called the noun, and the value placed in address 2 is called the verb. Each of the two input values will be between 0 and 99, inclusive.\n\nOnce the program has halted, its output is available at address 0, also just like before. Each time you try a pair of inputs, make sure you first reset the computer's memory to the values in the program (your puzzle input) - in other words, don't reuse memory from a previous attempt.\n\nFind the input noun and verb that cause the program to produce the output 19690720. What is 100 * noun + verb? (For example, if noun=12 and verb=2, the answer would be 1202.)\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    const content = try file.readToEndAlloc(allocator, 1024 * 1024);\n    defer allocator.free(content);\n\n    var original = std.ArrayList(u32).init(allocator);\n    defer original.deinit();\n\n    var it = std.mem.split(u8, content, \",\");\n    while (it.next()) |num_str| {\n        const num = try std.fmt.parseInt(u32, std.mem.trim(u8, num_str, &std.ascii.whitespace), 10);\n        try original.append(num);\n    }\n\n    var memory: [200]u32 = undefined;\n    const len = original.items.len;\n\n    for (0..100) |noun| {\n        for (0..100) |verb| {\n            @memcpy(memory[0..len], original.items);\n            memory[1] = @intCast(noun);\n            memory[2] = @intCast(verb);\n            if (execute(&memory, len) == 19690720) {\n                const result = 100 * noun + verb;\n                try std.io.getStdOut().writer().print(\"{d}\\n\", .{result});\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn execute(memory: []u32, len: usize) u32 {\n    var i: usize = 0;\n    while (i < len) : (i += 4) {\n        switch (memory[i]) {\n            1 => memory[memory[i + 3]] = memory[memory[i + 1]] + memory[memory[i + 2]],\n            2 => memory[memory[i + 3]] = memory[memory[i + 1]] * memory[memory[i + 2]],\n            99 => return memory[0],\n            else => unreachable,\n        }\n    }\n    return memory[0];\n}\n```\n"}]}

Any mass that would require negative fuel should instead be treated as if it requires zero fuel; the remaining mass, if any, is instead handled by wishing really hard, which has no mass and is outside the scope of this calculation.\n\nSo, for each module mass, calculate its fuel and add it to the total. Then, treat the fuel amount you just calculated as the input mass and repeat the process, continuing until a fuel requirement is zero or negative. For example:\n\nA module of mass 14 requires 2 fuel. This fuel requires no further fuel (2 divided by 3 and rounded down is 0, which would call for a negative fuel), so the total fuel required is still just 2.\nAt first, a module of mass 1969 requires 654 fuel. Then, this fuel requires 216 more fuel (654 / 3 - 2). 216 then requires 70 more fuel, which requires 21 fuel, which requires 5 fuel, which requires no further fuel. So, the total fuel required for a module of mass 1969 is 654 + 216 + 70 + 21 + 5 = 966.\nThe fuel required by a module of mass 100756 and its fuel is: 33583 + 11192 + 3728 + 1240 + 411 + 135 + 43 + 12 + 2 = 50346.\nWhat is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft when also taking into account the mass of the added fuel?

When you look up, you discover that the North Pole base construction project has completely surrounded you.\n\nThe area you are in is made up entirely of rooms and doors. The rooms are arranged in a grid, and rooms only connect to adjacent rooms when a door is present between them.\n\nFor example, drawing rooms as ., walls as #, doors as | or -, your current position as X, and where north is up, the area you're in might look like this:\n\n#####\n#.|.#\n#-###\n#.|X#\n#####\nYou get the attention of a passing construction Elf and ask for a map. \"I don't have time to draw out a map of this place - it's huge. Instead, I can give you directions to every room in the facility!\" He writes down some directions on a piece of parchment and runs off. In the example above, the instructions might have been ^WNE$, a regular expression or \"regex\" (your puzzle input).\n\nThe regex matches routes (like WNE for \"west, north, east\") that will take you from your current room through various doors in the facility. In aggregate, the routes will take you through every door in the facility at least once; mapping out all of these routes will let you build a proper map and find your way around.\n\n^ and $ are at the beginning and end of your regex; these just mean that the regex doesn't match anything outside the routes it describes. (Specifically, ^ matches the start of the route, and $ matches the end of it.) These characters will not appear elsewhere in the regex.\n\nThe rest of the regex matches various sequences of the characters N (north), S (south), E (east), and W (west). In the example above, ^WNE$ matches only one route, WNE, which means you can move west, then north, then east from your current position. Sequences of letters like this always match that exact route in the same order.\n\nSometimes, the route can branch. A branch is given by a list of options separated by pipes (|) and wrapped in parentheses. So, ^N(E|W)N$ contains a branch: after going north, you must choose to go either east or west before finishing your route by going north again. By tracing out the possible routes after branching, you can determine where the doors are and, therefore, where the rooms are in the facility.\n\nFor example, consider this regex: ^ENWWW(NEEE|SSE(EE|N))$\n\nThis regex begins with ENWWW, which means that from your current position, all routes must begin by moving east, north, and then west three times, in that order. After this, there is a branch. Before you consider the branch, this is what you know about the map so far, with doors you aren't sure about marked with a ?:\n\n#?#?#?#?#\n?.|.|.|.?\n#?#?#?#-#\n    ?X|.?\n    #?#?#\nAfter this point, there is (NEEE|SSE(EE|N)). This gives you exactly two options: NEEE and SSE(EE|N). By following NEEE, the map now looks like this:\n\n#?#?#?#?#\n?.|.|.|.?\n#-#?#?#?#\n?.|.|.|.?\n#?#?#?#-#\n    ?X|.?\n    #?#?#\nNow, only SSE(EE|N) remains. Because it is in the same parenthesized group as NEEE, it starts from the same room NEEE started in. It states that starting from that point, there exist doors which will allow you to move south twice, then east; this ends up at another branch. After that, you can either move east twice or north once. This information fills in the rest of the doors:\n\n#?#?#?#?#\n?.|.|.|.?\n#-#?#?#?#\n?.|.|.|.?\n#-#?#?#-#\n?.?.?X|.?\n#-#-#?#?#\n?.|.|.|.?\n#?#?#?#?#\nOnce you've followed all possible routes, you know the remaining unknown parts are all walls, producing a finished map of the facility:\n\n#########\n#.|.|.|.#\n#-#######\n#.|.|.|.#\n#-#####-#\n#.#.#X|.#\n#-#-#####\n#.|.|.|.#\n#########\nSometimes, a list of options can have an empty option, like (NEWS|WNSE|). This means that routes at this point could effectively skip the options in parentheses and move on immediately. For example, consider this regex and the corresponding map:\n\n^ENNWSWW(NEWS|)SSSEEN(WNSE|)EE(SWEN|)NNN$\n\n###########\n#.|.#.|.#.#\n#-###-#-#-#\n#.|.|.#.#.#\n#-#####-#-#\n#.#.#X|.#.#\n#-#-#####-#\n#.#.|.|.|.#\n#-###-###-#\n#.|.|.#.|.#\n###########\nThis regex has one main route which, at three locations, can optionally include additional detours and be valid: (NEWS|), (WNSE|), and (SWEN|). Regardless of which option is taken, the route continues from the position it is left at after taking those steps. So, for example, this regex matches all of the following routes (and more that aren't listed here):\n\nENNWSWWSSSEENEENNN\nENNWSWWNEWSSSSEENEENNN\nENNWSWWNEWSSSSEENEESWENNNN\nENNWSWWSSSEENWNSEEENNN\nBy following the various routes the regex matches, a full map of all of the doors and rooms in the facility can be assembled.\n\nTo get a sense for the size of this facility, you'd like to determine which room is furthest from you: specifically, you would like to find the room for which the shortest path to that room would require passing through the most doors.\n\nIn the first example (^WNE$), this would be the north-east corner 3 doors away.\nIn the second example (^ENWWW(NEEE|SSE(EE|N))$), this would be the south-east corner 10 doors away.\nIn the third example (^ENNWSWW(NEWS|)SSSEEN(WNSE|)EE(SWEN|)NNN$), this would be the north-east corner 18 doors away.\nHere are a few more examples:\n\nRegex: ^ESSWWN(E|NNENN(EESS(WNSE|)SSS|WWWSSSSE(SW|NNNE)))$\nFurthest room requires passing 23 doors\n\n#############\n#.|.|.|.|.|.#\n#-#####-###-#\n#.#.|.#.#.#.#\n#-#-###-#-#-#\n#.#.#.|.#.|.#\n#-#-#-#####-#\n#.#.#.#X|.#.#\n#-#-#-###-#-#\n#.|.#.|.#.#.#\n###-#-###-#-#\n#.|.#.|.|.#.#\n#############\nRegex: ^WSSEESWWWNW(S|NENNEEEENN(ESSSSW(NWSW|SSEN)|WSWWN(E|WWS(E|SS))))$\nFurthest room requires passing 31 doors\n\n###############\n#.|.|.|.#.|.|.#\n#-###-###-#-#-#\n#.|.#.|.|.#.#.#\n#-#########-#-#\n#.#.|.|.|.|.#.#\n#-#-#########-#\n#.#.#.|X#.|.#.#\n###-#-###-#-#-#\n#.|.#.#.|.#.|.#\n#-###-#####-###\n#.|.#.|.|.#.#.#\n#-#-#####-#-#-#\n#.#.|.|.|.#.|.#\n###############\nWhat is the largest number of doors you would be required to pass through to reach a room? That is, find the room for which the shortest path from your starting location to that room would require passing through the most doors; what is the fewest doors you can pass through to reach it?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 3721.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nOkay, so the facility is big.\n\nHow many rooms have a shortest path from your current location that pass through at least 1000 doors?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst Point = struct { x: i32, y: i32 };\nconst DoorMap = std.AutoHashMap(Point, std.AutoHashMap(Point, void));\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    const regex = try file.readToEndAlloc(allocator, 1024 * 1024);\n    defer allocator.free(regex);\n\n    var dm = try buildMap(allocator, regex[1 .. regex.len - 1]);\n    defer dm.deinit();\n\n    const rooms = try countRooms(allocator, dm, 1000);\n    try std.io.getStdOut().writer().print(\"{d}\\n\", .{rooms});\n}\n\nfn buildMap(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, regex: []const u8) !DoorMap {\n    var dm = DoorMap.init(allocator);\n    var stack = std.ArrayList(Point).init(allocator);\n    defer stack.deinit();\n\n    var cp = Point{ .x = 0, .y = 0 };\n\n    for (regex) |c| {\n        switch (c) {\n            '(' => try stack.append(cp),\n            '|' => cp = stack.items[stack.items.len - 1],\n            ')' => cp = stack.pop(),\n            'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' => {\n                const np = move(cp, c);\n                var entry = try dm.getOrPut(cp);\n                if (!entry.found_existing) {\n                    entry.value_ptr.* = std.AutoHashMap(Point, void).init(allocator);\n                }\n                try entry.value_ptr.*.put(np, {});\n                cp = np;\n            },\n            else => {},\n        }\n    }\n    return dm;\n}\n\nfn move(p: Point, dir: u8) Point {\n    return switch (dir) {\n        'N' => .{ .x = p.x, .y = p.y - 1 },\n        'S' => .{ .x = p.x, .y = p.y + 1 },\n        'E' => .{ .x = p.x + 1, .y = p.y },\n        'W' => .{ .x = p.x - 1, .y = p.y },\n        else => p,\n    };\n}\n\nfn countRooms(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, dm: DoorMap, min_doors: u32) !u32 {\n    var visited = std.AutoHashMap(Point, u32).init(allocator);\n    defer visited.deinit();\n\n    var queue = std.ArrayList(Point).init(allocator);\n    defer queue.deinit();\n\n    try queue.append(.{ .x = 0, .y = 0 });\n    try visited.put(.{ .x = 0, .y = 0 }, 0);\n\n    var room_count: u32 = 0;\n\n    while (queue.items.len > 0) {\n        const p = queue.orderedRemove(0);\n        const doors = visited.get(p).?;\n\n        if (dm.get(p)) |neighbors| {\n            var it = neighbors.keyIterator();\n            while (it.next()) |np| {\n                if (!visited.contains(np.*)) {\n                    const new_doors = doors + 1;\n                    try visited.put(np.*, new_doors);\n                    if (new_doors >= min_doors) {\n                        room_count += 1;\n                    }\n                    try queue.append(np.*);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return room_count;\n}\n```\n"}]}

Chocolate, cinnamon, mint, chili peppers, nutmeg, vanilla... the Elves must be growing these plants to make hot chocolate! As you realize this, you hear a conversation in the distance. When you go to investigate, you discover two Elves in what appears to be a makeshift underground kitchen/laboratory.\n\nThe Elves are trying to come up with the ultimate hot chocolate recipe; they're even maintaining a scoreboard which tracks the quality score (0-9) of each recipe.\n\nOnly two recipes are on the board: the first recipe got a score of 3, the second, 7. Each of the two Elves has a current recipe: the first Elf starts with the first recipe, and the second Elf starts with the second recipe.\n\nTo create new recipes, the two Elves combine their current recipes. This creates new recipes from the digits of the sum of the current recipes' scores. With the current recipes' scores of 3 and 7, their sum is 10, and so two new recipes would be created: the first with score 1 and the second with score 0. If the current recipes' scores were 2 and 3, the sum, 5, would only create one recipe (with a score of 5) with its single digit.\n\nThe new recipes are added to the end of the scoreboard in the order they are created. So, after the first round, the scoreboard is 3, 7, 1, 0.\n\nAfter all new recipes are added to the scoreboard, each Elf picks a new current recipe. To do this, the Elf steps forward through the scoreboard a number of recipes equal to 1 plus the score of their current recipe. So, after the first round, the first Elf moves forward 1 + 3 = 4 times, while the second Elf moves forward 1 + 7 = 8 times. If they run out of recipes, they loop back around to the beginning. After the first round, both Elves happen to loop around until they land on the same recipe that they had in the beginning; in general, they will move to different recipes.\n\nDrawing the first Elf as parentheses and the second Elf as square brackets, they continue this process:\n\n(3)[7]\n(3)[7] 1  0 \n 3  7  1 [0](1) 0 \n 3  7  1  0 [1] 0 (1)\n(3) 7  1  0  1  0 [1] 2 \n 3  7  1  0 (1) 0  1  2 [4]\n 3  7  1 [0] 1  0 (1) 2  4  5 \n 3  7  1  0 [1] 0  1  2 (4) 5  1 \n 3 (7) 1  0  1  0 [1] 2  4  5  1  5 \n 3  7  1  0  1  0  1  2 [4](5) 1  5  8 \n 3 (7) 1  0  1  0  1  2  4  5  1  5  8 [9]\n 3  7  1  0  1  0  1 [2] 4 (5) 1  5  8  9  1  6 \n 3  7  1  0  1  0  1  2  4  5 [1] 5  8  9  1 (6) 7 \n 3  7  1  0 (1) 0  1  2  4  5  1  5 [8] 9  1  6  7  7 \n 3  7 [1] 0  1  0 (1) 2  4  5  1  5  8  9  1  6  7  7  9 \n 3  7  1  0 [1] 0  1  2 (4) 5  1  5  8  9  1  6  7  7  9  2 \nThe Elves think their skill will improve after making a few recipes (your puzzle input). However, that could take ages; you can speed this up considerably by identifying the scores of the ten recipes after that. For example:\n\nIf the Elves think their skill will improve after making 9 recipes, the scores of the ten recipes after the first nine on the scoreboard would be 5158916779 (highlighted in the last line of the diagram).\nAfter 5 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 0124515891.\nAfter 18 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 9251071085.\nAfter 2018 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 5941429882.\nWhat are the scores of the ten recipes immediately after the number of recipes in your puzzle input?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 1413131339.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nAs it turns out, you got the Elves' plan backwards.

After the first round, both Elves happen to loop around until they land on the same recipe that they had in the beginning; in general, they will move to different recipes.\n\nDrawing the first Elf as parentheses and the second Elf as square brackets, they continue this process:\n\n(3)[7]\n(3)[7] 1  0 \n 3  7  1 [0](1) 0 \n 3  7  1  0 [1] 0 (1)\n(3) 7  1  0  1  0 [1] 2 \n 3  7  1  0 (1) 0  1  2 [4]\n 3  7  1 [0] 1  0 (1) 2  4  5 \n 3  7  1  0 [1] 0  1  2 (4) 5  1 \n 3 (7) 1  0  1  0 [1] 2  4  5  1  5 \n 3  7  1  0  1  0  1  2 [4](5) 1  5  8 \n 3 (7) 1  0  1  0  1  2  4  5  1  5  8 [9]\n 3  7  1  0  1  0  1 [2] 4 (5) 1  5  8  9  1  6 \n 3  7  1  0  1  0  1  2  4  5 [1] 5  8  9  1 (6) 7 \n 3  7  1  0 (1) 0  1  2  4  5  1  5 [8] 9  1  6  7  7 \n 3  7 [1] 0  1  0 (1) 2  4  5  1  5  8  9  1  6  7  7  9 \n 3  7  1  0 [1] 0  1  2 (4) 5  1  5  8  9  1  6  7  7  9  2 \nThe Elves think their skill will improve after making a few recipes (your puzzle input). However, that could take ages; you can speed this up considerably by identifying the scores of the ten recipes after that. For example:\n\nIf the Elves think their skill will improve after making 9 recipes, the scores of the ten recipes after the first nine on the scoreboard would be 5158916779 (highlighted in the last line of the diagram).\nAfter 5 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 0124515891.\nAfter 18 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 9251071085.\nAfter 2018 recipes, the scores of the next ten would be 5941429882.\nWhat are the scores of the ten recipes immediately after the number of recipes in your puzzle input?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    const input = try readInput(file);\n\n    var scoreboard = try std.ArrayList(u8).initCapacity(allocator, input + 10);\n    defer scoreboard.deinit();\n\n    scoreboard.appendSlice(&[_]u8{ 3, 7 }) catch unreachable;\n\n    var elf1: usize = 0;\n    var elf2: usize = 1;\n\n    while (scoreboard.items.len < input + 10) {\n        const new_score = scoreboard.items[elf1] + scoreboard.items[elf2];\n        if (new_score >= 10) {\n            scoreboard.append(new_score / 10) catch unreachable;\n        }\n        scoreboard.append(new_score % 10) catch unreachable;\n\n        elf1 = (elf1 + scoreboard.items[elf1] + 1) % scoreboard.items.len;\n        elf2 = (elf2 + scoreboard.items[elf2] + 1) % scoreboard.items.len;\n    }\n\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    for (scoreboard.items[input..input+10]) |score| {\n        try stdout.print(\"{d}\", .{score});\n    }\n    try stdout.print(\"\\n\", .{});\n}\n\nfn readInput(file: std.fs.File) !usize {\n    var buf: [20]u8 = undefined;\n    const bytes_read = try file.readAll(&buf);\n    return try std.fmt.parseInt(usize, buf[0..bytes_read], 10);\n}\n```\n"}]}

The Elves are very busy pushing things around in carts on some kind of rudimentary system of tracks they've come up with.\n\nSeeing as how cart-and-track systems don't appear in recorded history for another 1000 years, the Elves seem to be making this up as they go along. They haven't even figured out how to avoid collisions yet.\n\nYou map out the tracks (your puzzle input) and see where you can help.\n\nTracks consist of straight paths (| and -), curves (/ and ), and intersections (+). Curves connect exactly two perpendicular pieces of track; for example, this is a closed loop:\n\n/----|    |\n|    |\n----/\nIntersections occur when two perpendicular paths cross. At an intersection, a cart is capable of turning left, turning right, or continuing straight. Here are two loops connected by two intersections:\n\n/-----|     |\n|  /--+--|  |  |  |\n--+--/  |\n   |     |\n   -----/\nSeveral carts are also on the tracks. Carts always face either up (^), down (v), left (<), or right (>). (On your initial map, the track under each cart is a straight path matching the direction the cart is facing.)\n\nEach time a cart has the option to turn (by arriving at any intersection), it turns left the first time, goes straight the second time, turns right the third time, and then repeats those directions starting again with left the fourth time, straight the fifth time, and so on. This process is independent of the particular intersection at which the cart has arrived - that is, the cart has no per-intersection memory.\n\nCarts all move at the same speed; they take turns moving a single step at a time. They do this based on their current location: carts on the top row move first (acting from left to right), then carts on the second row move (again from left to right), then carts on the third row, and so on. Once each cart has moved one step, the process repeats; each of these loops is called a tick.\n\nFor example, suppose there are two carts on a straight track:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\nv  |  |  |  |\n|  v  v  |  |\n|  |  |  v  X\n|  |  ^  ^  |\n^  ^  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\nFirst, the top cart moves. It is facing down (v), so it moves down one square. Second, the bottom cart moves. It is facing up (^), so it moves up one square. Because all carts have moved, the first tick ends. Then, the process repeats, starting with the first cart. The first cart moves down, then the second cart moves up - right into the first cart, colliding with it! (The location of the crash is marked with an X.) This ends the second and last tick.\n\nHere is a longer example:\n\n/->-        \n|   |  /----| /-+--+-  |\n| | |  | v  |\n-+-/  -+--/\n  ------/   \n\n/-->        \n|   |  /----| /-+--+-  |\n| | |  | |  |\n-+-/  ->--/\n  ------/   \n\n/---v        \n|   |  /----| /-+--+-  |\n| | |  | |  |\n-+-/  -+>-/\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   v  /----| /-+--+-  |\n| | |  | |  |\n-+-/  -+->/\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   |  /----| /->--+-  |\n| | |  | |  |\n-+-/  -+--^\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   |  /----| /-+>-+-  |\n| | |  | |  ^\n-+-/  -+--/\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   |  /----| /-+->+-  ^\n| | |  | |  |\n-+-/  -+--/\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   |  /----<\n| /-+-->-  |\n| | |  | |  |\n-+-/  -+--/\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   |  /---<| /-+--+>  |\n| | |  | |  |\n-+-/  -+--/\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   |  /--<-| /-+--+-v  |\n| | |  | |  |\n-+-/  -+--/\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   |  /-<--| /-+--+-  |\n| | |  | v  |\n-+-/  -+--/\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   |  /<---| /-+--+-  |\n| | |  | |  |\n-+-/  -<--/\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   |  v----| /-+--+-  |\n| | |  | |  |\n-+-/  <+--/\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   |  /----| /-+--v-  |\n| | |  | |  |\n-+-/  ^-+--/\n  ------/   \n\n/---        \n|   |  /----| /-+--+-  |\n| | |  X |  |\n-+-/  -+--/\n  ------/   \nAfter following their respective paths for a while, the carts eventually crash.

Either that, or you've arrived in a vast cavern network under the North Pole.\n\nAfter exploring a little, you discover a long tunnel that contains a row of small pots as far as you can see to your left and right. A few of them contain plants - someone is trying to grow things in these geothermally-heated caves.\n\nThe pots are numbered, with 0 in front of you. To the left, the pots are numbered -1, -2, -3, and so on; to the right, 1, 2, 3.... Your puzzle input contains a list of pots from 0 to the right and whether they do (#) or do not (.) currently contain a plant, the initial state. (No other pots currently contain plants.) For example, an initial state of #..##.... indicates that pots 0, 3, and 4 currently contain plants.\n\nYour puzzle input also contains some notes you find on a nearby table: someone has been trying to figure out how these plants spread to nearby pots. Based on the notes, for each generation of plants, a given pot has or does not have a plant based on whether that pot (and the two pots on either side of it) had a plant in the last generation. These are written as LLCRR => N, where L are pots to the left, C is the current pot being considered, R are the pots to the right, and N is whether the current pot will have a plant in the next generation. For example:\n\nA note like ..#.. => . means that a pot that contains a plant but with no plants within two pots of it will not have a plant in it during the next generation.\nA note like ##.## => . means that an empty pot with two plants on each side of it will remain empty in the next generation.\nA note like .##.# => # means that a pot has a plant in a given generation if, in the previous generation, there were plants in that pot, the one immediately to the left, and the one two pots to the right, but not in the ones immediately to the right and two to the left.\nIt's not clear what these plants are for, but you're sure it's important, so you'd like to make sure the current configuration of plants is sustainable by determining what will happen after 20 generations.\n\nFor example, given the following input:\n\ninitial state: #..#.#..##......###...###\n\n...## => #\n..#.. => #\n.#... => #\n.#.#. => #\n.#.## => #\n.##.. => #\n.#### => #\n#.#.# => #\n#.### => #\n##.#. => #\n##.## => #\n###.. => #\n###.# => #\n####. => #\nFor brevity, in this example, only the combinations which do produce a plant are listed. (Your input includes all possible combinations.) Then, the next 20 generations will look like this:\n\n                 1         2         3     \n       0         0         0         0     \n 0: ...#..#.#..##......###...###...........\n 1: ...#...#....#.....#..#..#..#...........\n 2: ...##..##...##....#..#..#..##..........\n 3: ..#.#...#..#.#....#..#..#...#..........\n 4: ...#.#..#...#.#...#..#..##..##.........\n 5: ....#...##...#.#..#..#...#...#.........\n 6: ....##.#.#....#...#..##..##..##........\n 7: ...#..###.#...##..#...#...#...#........\n 8: ...#....##.#.#.#..##..##..##..##.......\n 9: ...##..#..#####....#...#...#...#.......\n10: ..#.#..#...#.##....##..##..##..##......\n11: ...#...##...#.#...#.#...#...#...#......\n12: ...##.#.#....#.#...#.#..##..##..##.....\n13: ..#..###.#....#.#...#....#...#...#.....\n14: ..#....##.#....#.#..##...##..##..##....\n15: ..##..#..#.#....#....#..#.#...#...#....\n16: .#.#..#...#.#...##...#...#.#..##..##...\n17: ..#...##...#.#.#.#...##...#....#...#...\n18: ..##.#.#....#####.#.#.#...##...##..##..\n19: .#..###.#..#.#.#######.#.#.#..#.#...#..\n20: .#....##....#####...#######....#.#..##.\nThe generation is shown along the left, where 0 is the initial state. The pot numbers are shown along the top, where 0 labels the center pot, negative-numbered pots extend to the left, and positive pots extend toward the right.

The numbers define a data structure which, when processed, produces some kind of tree that can be used to calculate the license number.\n\nThe tree is made up of nodes; a single, outermost node forms the tree's root, and it contains all other nodes in the tree (or contains nodes that contain nodes, and so on).\n\nSpecifically, a node consists of:\n\nA header, which is always exactly two numbers:\nThe quantity of child nodes.\nThe quantity of metadata entries.\nZero or more child nodes (as specified in the header).\nOne or more metadata entries (as specified in the header).\nEach child node is itself a node that has its own header, child nodes, and metadata.

So, the value of node B is 10+11+12=33, and the value of node D is 99.\n\nHowever, if a node does have child nodes, the metadata entries become indexes which refer to those child nodes. A metadata entry of 1 refers to the first child node, 2 to the second, 3 to the third, and so on. The value of this node is the sum of the values of the child nodes referenced by the metadata entries. If a referenced child node does not exist, that reference is skipped. A child node can be referenced multiple time and counts each time it is referenced. A metadata entry of 0 does not refer to any child node.\n\nFor example, again using the above nodes:\n\nNode C has one metadata entry, 2. Because node C has only one child node, 2 references a child node which does not exist, and so the value of node C is 0.\nNode A has three metadata entries: 1, 1, and 2. The 1 references node A's first child node, B, and the 2 references node A's second child node, C. Because node B has a value of 33 and node C has a value of 0, the value of node A is 33+33+0=66.\nSo, in this example, the value of the root node is 66.\n\nWhat is the value of the root node?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst ArrayList = std.ArrayList;\n\nfn readInput(allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !ArrayList(u32) {\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var buf_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n\n    var numbers = ArrayList(u32).init(allocator);\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, ' ')) |num_str| {\n        const num = try std.fmt.parseInt(u32, num_str, 10);\n        try numbers.append(num);\n    }\n    return numbers;\n}\n\nfn parseTree(data: []const u32, index: *usize) u32 {\n    const child_count = data[index.*];\n    const meta_count = data[index.* + 1];\n    index.* += 2;\n\n    var child_values: [16]u32 = undefined;\n    var value: u32 = 0;\n\n    if (child_count == 0) {\n        var i: usize = 0;\n        while (i < meta_count) : (i += 1) {\n            value += data[index.* + i];\n        }\n    } else {\n        var i: usize = 0;\n        while (i < child_count) : (i += 1) {\n            child_values[i] = parseTree(data, index);\n        }\n        i = 0;\n        while (i < meta_count) : (i += 1) {\n            const metadata = data[index.* + i];\n            if (metadata <= child_count and metadata > 0) {\n                value += child_values[metadata - 1];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    index.* += meta_count;\n    return value;\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    var numbers = try readInput(allocator);\n    defer numbers.deinit();\n\n    var index: usize = 0;\n    const result = parseTree(numbers.items, &index);\n    try std.io.getStdOut().writer().print(\"{}\\n\", .{result});\n}\n```\n"}]}

Multiplying these together produces a checksum of 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nWhat is the checksum for your list of box IDs?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var line_reader = reader.reader();\n\n    var twos_count: i32 = 0;\n    var threes_count: i32 = 0;\n\n    var buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    while (try line_reader.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buffer, '\\n')) |line| {\n        var letter_counts = [_]i32{0} ** 26;\n\n        for (line) |char| {\n            const idx = char - 'a';\n            if (idx >= 0 and idx < 26) {\n                letter_counts[idx] += 1;\n            }\n        }\n\n        var found_twos: bool = false;\n        var found_threes: bool = false;\n\n        for (letter_counts) |count| {\n            if (count == 2) found_twos = true;\n            if (count == 3) found_threes = true;\n        }\n\n        if (found_twos) twos_count += 1;\n        if (found_threes) threes_count += 1;\n    }\n\n    const checksum = twos_count * threes_count;\n    std.debug.print(\"{}\\n\", .{checksum});\n}\n```\n"}]}

As you get close, you find an experimental coprocessor doing so much work that the local programs are afraid it will halt and catch fire. This would cause serious issues for the rest of the computer, so you head in and see what you can do.\n\nThe code it's running seems to be a variant of the kind you saw recently on that tablet. The general functionality seems very similar, but some of the instructions are different:\n\nset X Y sets register X to the value of Y.\nsub X Y decreases register X by the value of Y.\nmul X Y sets register X to the result of multiplying the value contained in register X by the value of Y.\njnz X Y jumps with an offset of the value of Y, but only if the value of X is not zero. (An offset of 2 skips the next instruction, an offset of -1 jumps to the previous instruction, and so on.)\nOnly the instructions listed above are used. The eight registers here, named a through h, all start at 0.\n\nThe coprocessor is currently set to some kind of debug mode, which allows for testing, but prevents it from doing any meaningful work.\n\nIf you run the program (your puzzle input), how many times is the mul instruction invoked?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 3025.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow, it's time to fix the problem.\n\nThe debug mode switch is wired directly to register a. You flip the switch, which makes register a now start at 1 when the program is executed.\n\nImmediately, the coprocessor begins to overheat.

The grid computing cluster is a seemingly-infinite two-dimensional grid of compute nodes. Each node is either clean or infected by the virus.\n\nTo prevent overloading the nodes (which would render them useless to the virus) or detection by system administrators, exactly one virus carrier moves through the network, infecting or cleaning nodes as it moves. The virus carrier is always located on a single node in the network (the current node) and keeps track of the direction it is facing.\n\nTo avoid detection, the virus carrier works in bursts; in each burst, it wakes up, does some work, and goes back to sleep. The following steps are all executed in order one time each burst:\n\nIf the current node is infected, it turns to its right. Otherwise, it turns to its left. (Turning is done in-place; the current node does not change.)\nIf the current node is clean, it becomes infected. Otherwise, it becomes cleaned. (This is done after the node is considered for the purposes of changing direction.)\nThe virus carrier moves forward one node in the direction it is facing.\nDiagnostics have also provided a map of the node infection status (your puzzle input). Clean nodes are shown as .; infected nodes are shown as #. This map only shows the center of the grid; there are many more nodes beyond those shown, but none of them are currently infected.\n\nThe virus carrier begins in the middle of the map facing up.\n\nFor example, suppose you are given a map like this:\n\n..#\n#..\n...\nThen, the middle of the infinite grid looks like this, with the virus carrier's position marked with [ ]:\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . # . . .\n. . . #[.]. . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\nThe virus carrier is on a clean node, so it turns left, infects the node, and moves left:\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . # . . .\n. . .[#]# . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\nThe virus carrier is on an infected node, so it turns right, cleans the node, and moves up:\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . .[.]. # . . .\n. . . . # . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\nFour times in a row, the virus carrier finds a clean, infects it, turns left, and moves forward, ending in the same place and still facing up:\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . #[#]. # . . .\n. . # # # . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\nNow on the same node as before, it sees an infection, which causes it to turn right, clean the node, and move forward:\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . # .[.]# . . .\n. . # # # . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\nAfter the above actions, a total of 7 bursts of activity had taken place. Of them, 5 bursts of activity caused an infection.\n\nAfter a total of 70, the grid looks like this, with the virus carrier facing up:\n\n. . . . . # # . .\n. . . . # . . # .\n. . . # . . . . #\n. . # . #[.]. . #\n. . # . # . . # .\n. . . . . # # . .\n. . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . .\nBy this time, 41 bursts of activity caused an infection (though most of those nodes have since been cleaned).\n\nAfter a total of 10000 bursts of activity, 5587 bursts will have caused an infection.\n\nGiven your actual map, after 10000 bursts of activity, how many bursts cause a node to become infected?

Someone has asked it to simulate too many particles, and it won't be able to finish them all in time to render the next frame at this rate.\n\nIt transmits to you a buffer (your puzzle input) listing each particle in order (starting with particle 0, then particle 1, particle 2, and so on). For each particle, it provides the X, Y, and Z coordinates for the particle's position (p), velocity (v), and acceleration (a), each in the format <X,Y,Z>.\n\nEach tick, all particles are updated simultaneously. A particle's properties are updated in the following order:\n\nIncrease the X velocity by the X acceleration.\nIncrease the Y velocity by the Y acceleration.\nIncrease the Z velocity by the Z acceleration.\nIncrease the X position by the X velocity.\nIncrease the Y position by the Y velocity.\nIncrease the Z position by the Z velocity.\nBecause of seemingly tenuous rationale involving z-buffering, the GPU would like to know which particle will stay closest to position <0,0,0> in the long term. Measure this using the Manhattan distance, which in this situation is simply the sum of the absolute values of a particle's X, Y, and Z position.\n\nFor example, suppose you are only given two particles, both of which stay entirely on the X-axis (for simplicity). Drawing the current states of particles 0 and 1 (in that order) with an adjacent a number line and diagram of current X positions (marked in parentheses), the following would take place:\n\np=< 3,0,0>, v=< 2,0,0>, a=<-1,0,0>    -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4\np=< 4,0,0>, v=< 0,0,0>, a=<-2,0,0>                         (0)(1)\n\np=< 4,0,0>, v=< 1,0,0>, a=<-1,0,0>    -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4\np=< 2,0,0>, v=<-2,0,0>, a=<-2,0,0>                      (1)   (0)\n\np=< 4,0,0>, v=< 0,0,0>, a=<-1,0,0>    -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4\np=<-2,0,0>, v=<-4,0,0>, a=<-2,0,0>          (1)               (0)\n\np=< 3,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=<-1,0,0>    -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4\np=<-8,0,0>, v=<-6,0,0>, a=<-2,0,0>                         (0)   \nAt this point, particle 1 will never be closer to <0,0,0> than particle 0, and so, in the long run, particle 0 will stay closest.\n\nWhich particle will stay closest to position <0,0,0> in the long term?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 125.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nTo simplify the problem further, the GPU would like to remove any particles that collide. Particles collide if their positions ever exactly match. Because particles are updated simultaneously, more than two particles can collide at the same time and place. Once particles collide, they are removed and cannot collide with anything else after that tick.\n\nFor example:\n\np=<-6,0,0>, v=< 3,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    \np=<-4,0,0>, v=< 2,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\np=<-2,0,0>, v=< 1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    (0)   (1)   (2)            (3)\np=< 3,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>\n\np=<-3,0,0>, v=< 3,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    \np=<-2,0,0>, v=< 2,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\np=<-1,0,0>, v=< 1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>             (0)(1)(2)      (3)   \np=< 2,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>\n\np=< 0,0,0>, v=< 3,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    \np=< 0,0,0>, v=< 2,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\np=< 0,0,0>, v=< 1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>                       X (3)      \np=< 1,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>\n\n------destroyed by collision------    \n------destroyed by collision------    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\n------destroyed by collision------                      (3)         \np=< 0,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>\nIn this example, particles 0, 1, and 2 are simultaneously destroyed at the time and place marked X.

Lines (drawn with |, -, and +) show the path it needs to take, starting by going down onto the only line connected to the top of the diagram.

The generators, called generator A and generator B, are trying to agree on a sequence of numbers. However, one of them is malfunctioning, and so the sequences don't always match.\n\nAs they do this, a judge waits for each of them to generate its next value, compares the lowest 16 bits of both values, and keeps track of the number of times those parts of the values match.\n\nThe generators both work on the same principle. To create its next value, a generator will take the previous value it produced, multiply it by a factor (generator A uses 16807; generator B uses 48271), and then keep the remainder of dividing that resulting product by 2147483647. That final remainder is the value it produces next.\n\nTo calculate each generator's first value, it instead uses a specific starting value as its \"previous value\" (as listed in your puzzle input).\n\nFor example, suppose that for starting values, generator A uses 65, while generator B uses 8921. Then, the first five pairs of generated values are:\n\n--Gen. A--  --Gen. B--\n  1092455   430625591\n1181022009  1233683848\n245556042  1431495498\n1744312007   137874439\n1352636452   285222916\nIn binary, these pairs are (with generator A's value first in each pair):\n\n00000000000100001010101101100111\n00011001101010101101001100110111\n\n01000110011001001111011100111001\n01001001100010001000010110001000\n\n00001110101000101110001101001010\n01010101010100101110001101001010\n\n01100111111110000001011011000111\n00001000001101111100110000000111\n\n01010000100111111001100000100100\n00010001000000000010100000000100\nHere, you can see that the lowest (here, rightmost) 16 bits of the third value match: 1110001101001010. Because of this one match, after processing these five pairs, the judge would have added only 1 to its total.\n\nTo get a significant sample, the judge would like to consider 40 million pairs. (In the example above, the judge would eventually find a total of 588 pairs that match in their lowest 16 bits.)\n\nAfter 40 million pairs, what is the judge's final count?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 594.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nIn the interest of trying to align a little better, the generators get more picky about the numbers they actually give to the judge.\n\nThey still generate values in the same way, but now they only hand a value to the judge when it meets their criteria:\n\nGenerator A looks for values that are multiples of 4.\nGenerator B looks for values that are multiples of 8.\nEach generator functions completely independently: they both go through values entirely on their own, only occasionally handing an acceptable value to the judge, and otherwise working through the same sequence of values as before until they find one.\n\nThe judge still waits for each generator to provide it with a value before comparing them (using the same comparison method as before). It keeps track of the order it receives values; the first values from each generator are compared, then the second values from each generator, then the third values, and so on.\n\nUsing the example starting values given above, the generators now produce the following first five values each:\n\n--Gen. A--  --Gen. B--\n1352636452  1233683848\n1992081072   862516352\n530830436  1159784568\n1980017072  1616057672\n740335192   412269392\nThese values have the following corresponding binary values:\n\n01010000100111111001100000100100\n01001001100010001000010110001000\n\n01110110101111001011111010110000\n00110011011010001111010010000000\n\n00011111101000111101010001100100\n01000101001000001110100001111000\n\n01110110000001001010100110110000\n01100000010100110001010101001000\n\n00101100001000001001111001011000\n00011000100100101011101101010000\nUnfortunately, even though this change makes more bits similar on average, none of these values' lowest 16 bits match.

The firewall consists of several layers, each with a security scanner that moves back and forth across the layer. To succeed, you must not be detected by a scanner.\n\nBy studying the firewall briefly, you are able to record (in your puzzle input) the depth of each layer and the range of the scanning area for the scanner within it, written as depth: range. Each layer has a thickness of exactly 1. A layer at depth 0 begins immediately inside the firewall; a layer at depth 1 would start immediately after that.\n\nFor example, suppose you've recorded the following:\n\n0: 3\n1: 2\n4: 4\n6: 4\nThis means that there is a layer immediately inside the firewall (with range 3), a second layer immediately after that (with range 2), a third layer which begins at depth 4 (with range 4), and a fourth layer which begins at depth 6 (also with range 4).

Each security scanner starts at the top and moves down until it reaches the bottom, then moves up until it reaches the top, and repeats. A security scanner takes one picosecond to move one step.

The packet will travel along the top of each layer, and it moves at one layer per picosecond. Each picosecond, the packet moves one layer forward (its first move takes it into layer 0), and then the scanners move one step. If there is a scanner at the top of the layer as your packet enters it, you are caught. (If a scanner moves into the top of its layer while you are there, you are not caught: it doesn't have time to notice you before you leave.) If you were to do this in the configuration above, marking your current position with parentheses, your passage through the firewall would look like this:\n\nInitial state:\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[S] [S] ... ...

You are not caught in layer 1, since the scanner moved into the top of the layer once you were already there.\n\nThe severity of getting caught on a layer is equal to its depth multiplied by its range. (Ignore layers in which you do not get caught.) The severity of the whole trip is the sum of these values. In the example above, the trip severity is 0*3 + 6*4 = 24.\n\nGiven the details of the firewall you've recorded, if you leave immediately, what is the severity of your whole trip?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 1960.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow, you need to pass through the firewall without being caught - easier said than done.\n\nYou can't control the speed of the packet, but you can delay it any number of picoseconds. For each picosecond you delay the packet before beginning your trip, all security scanners move one step. You're not in the firewall during this time; you don't enter layer 0 until you stop delaying the packet.\n\nIn the example above, if you delay 10 picoseconds (picoseconds 0 - 9), you won't get caught:\n\nState after delaying:\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[ ] [S] ... ...

The packet will travel along the top of each layer, and it moves at one layer per picosecond. Each picosecond, the packet moves one layer forward (its first move takes it into layer 0), and then the scanners move one step. If there is a scanner at the top of the layer as your packet enters it, you are caught. (If a scanner moves into the top of its layer while you are there, you are not caught: it doesn't have time to notice you before you leave.) If you were to do this in the configuration above, marking your current position with parentheses, your passage through the firewall would look like this:\n\nInitial state:\n0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[S] [S] ... ...

Lengths larger than the size of the list are invalid.\n\nHere's an example using a smaller list:\n\nSuppose we instead only had a circular list containing five elements, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and were given input lengths of 3, 4, 1, 5.\n\nThe list begins as [0] 1 2 3 4 (where square brackets indicate the current position).\nThe first length, 3, selects ([0] 1 2) 3 4 (where parentheses indicate the sublist to be reversed).\nAfter reversing that section (0 1 2 into 2 1 0), we get ([2] 1 0) 3 4.\nThen, the current position moves forward by the length, 3, plus the skip size, 0: 2 1 0 [3] 4. Finally, the skip size increases to 1.\nThe second length, 4, selects a section which wraps: 2 1) 0 ([3] 4.\nThe sublist 3 4 2 1 is reversed to form 1 2 4 3: 4 3) 0 ([1] 2.\nThe current position moves forward by the length plus the skip size, a total of 5, causing it not to move because it wraps around: 4 3 0 [1] 2. The skip size increases to 2.\nThe third length, 1, selects a sublist of a single element, and so reversing it has no effect.\nThe current position moves forward by the length (1) plus the skip size (2): 4 [3] 0 1 2. The skip size increases to 3.\nThe fourth length, 5, selects every element starting with the second: 4) ([3] 0 1 2. Reversing this sublist (3 0 1 2 4 into 4 2 1 0 3) produces: 3) ([4] 2 1 0.\nFinally, the current position moves forward by 8: 3 4 2 1 [0]. The skip size increases to 4.\nIn this example, the first two numbers in the list end up being 3 and 4; to check the process, you can multiply them together to produce 12.\n\nHowever, you should instead use the standard list size of 256 (with values 0 to 255) and the sequence of lengths in your puzzle input. Once this process is complete, what is the result of multiplying the first two numbers in the list?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 40132.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe logic you've constructed forms a single round of the Knot Hash algorithm; running the full thing requires many of these rounds. Some input and output processing is also required.\n\nFirst, from now on, your input should be taken not as a list of numbers, but as a string of bytes instead. Unless otherwise specified, convert characters to bytes using their ASCII codes. This will allow you to handle arbitrary ASCII strings, and it also ensures that your input lengths are never larger than 255. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, you should convert it to the ASCII codes for each character: 49,44,50,44,51.\n\nOnce you have determined the sequence of lengths to use, add the following lengths to the end of the sequence: 17, 31, 73, 47, 23. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, your final sequence of lengths should be 49,44,50,44,51,17,31,73,47,23 (the ASCII codes from the input string combined with the standard length suffix values).\n\nSecond, instead of merely running one round like you did above, run a total of 64 rounds, using the same length sequence in each round. The current position and skip size should be preserved between rounds. For example, if the previous example was your first round, you would start your second round with the same length sequence (3, 4, 1, 5, 17, 31, 73, 47, 23, now assuming they came from ASCII codes and include the suffix), but start with the previous round's current position (4) and skip size (4).\n\nOnce the rounds are complete, you will be left with the numbers from 0 to 255 in some order, called the sparse hash. Your next task is to reduce these to a list of only 16 numbers called the dense hash. To do this, use numeric bitwise XOR to combine each consecutive block of 16 numbers in the sparse hash (there are 16 such blocks in a list of 256 numbers). So, the first element in the dense hash is the first sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, the second element in the dense hash is the second sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, etc.\n\nFor example, if the first sixteen elements of your sparse hash are as shown below, and the XOR operator is ^, you would calculate the first output number like this:\n\n65 ^ 27 ^ 9 ^ 1 ^ 4 ^ 3 ^ 40 ^ 50 ^ 91 ^ 7 ^ 6 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 5 ^ 68 ^ 22 = 64\nPerform this operation on each of the sixteen blocks of sixteen numbers in your sparse hash to determine the sixteen numbers in your dense hash.\n\nFinally, the standard way to represent a Knot Hash is as a single hexadecimal string; the final output is the dense hash in hexadecimal notation. Because each number in your dense hash will be between 0 and 255 (inclusive), always represent each number as two hexadecimal digits (including a leading zero as necessary). So, if your first three numbers are 64, 7, 255, they correspond to the hexadecimal numbers 40, 07, ff, and so the first six characters of the hash would be 4007ff. Because every Knot Hash is sixteen such numbers, the hexadecimal representation is always 32 hexadecimal digits (0-f) long.\n\nHere are some example hashes:\n\nThe empty string becomes a2582a3a0e66e6e86e3812dcb672a272.\nAoC 2017 becomes 33efeb34ea91902bb2f59c9920caa6cd.\n1,2,3 becomes 3efbe78a8d82f29979031a4aa0b16a9d.\n1,2,4 becomes 63960835bcdc130f0b66d7ff4f6a5a8e.\nTreating your puzzle input as a string of ASCII characters, what is the Knot Hash of your puzzle input?

The sculpture is in a sealed enclosure and seems to involve a set of identical spherical capsules that are carried to the top and allowed to bounce through the maze of spinning pieces.\n\nPart of the sculpture is even interactive! When a button is pressed, a capsule is dropped and tries to fall through slots in a set of rotating discs to finally go through a little hole at the bottom and come out of the sculpture. If any of the slots aren't aligned with the capsule as it passes, the capsule bounces off the disc and soars away. You feel compelled to get one of those capsules.\n\nThe discs pause their motion each second and come in different sizes; they seem to each have a fixed number of positions at which they stop. You decide to call the position with the slot 0, and count up for each position it reaches next.\n\nFurthermore, the discs are spaced out so that after you push the button, one second elapses before the first disc is reached, and one second elapses as the capsule passes from one disc to the one below it. So, if you push the button at time=100, then the capsule reaches the top disc at time=101, the second disc at time=102, the third disc at time=103, and so on.\n\nThe button will only drop a capsule at an integer time - no fractional seconds allowed.\n\nFor example, at time=0, suppose you see the following arrangement:\n\nDisc #1 has 5 positions; at time=0, it is at position 4.\nDisc #2 has 2 positions; at time=0, it is at position 1.\nIf you press the button exactly at time=0, the capsule would start to fall; it would reach the first disc at time=1. Since the first disc was at position 4 at time=0, by time=1 it has ticked one position forward. As a five-position disc, the next position is 0, and the capsule falls through the slot.\n\nThen, at time=2, the capsule reaches the second disc. The second disc has ticked forward two positions at this point: it started at position 1, then continued to position 0, and finally ended up at position 1 again. Because there's only a slot at position 0, the capsule bounces away.\n\nIf, however, you wait until time=5 to push the button, then when the capsule reaches each disc, the first disc will have ticked forward 5+1 = 6 times (to position 0), and the second disc will have ticked forward 5+2 = 7 times (also to position 0). In this case, the capsule would fall through the discs and come out of the machine.\n\nHowever, your situation has more than two discs; you've noted their positions in your puzzle input. What is the first time you can press the button to get a capsule?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst fs = std.fs;\nconst io = std.io;\nconst mem = std.mem;\nconst fmt = std.fmt;\n\nconst Disc = struct {\n    positions: u32,\n    start_position: u32,\n};\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const file = try fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var buf_reader = io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n\n    var discs = std.ArrayList(Disc).init(allocator);\n    defer discs.deinit();\n\n    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |line| {\n        var it = mem.split(u8, line, \" \");\n        _ = it.next(); // Skip \"Disc\"\n        _ = it.next(); // Skip \"#X\"\n        _ = it.next(); // Skip \"has\"\n        const positions = try fmt.parseInt(u32, it.next().?, 10);\n        _ = it.next(); // Skip \"positions;\"\n        _ = it.next(); // Skip \"at\"\n        _ = it.next(); // Skip \"time=0,\"\n        _ = it.next(); // Skip \"it\"\n        _ = it.next(); // Skip \"is\"\n        _ = it.next(); // Skip \"at\"\n        _ = it.next(); // Skip \"position\"\n        const start_position = try fmt.parseInt(u32, it.next().?[0..1], 10);\n\n        try discs.append(Disc{ .positions = positions, .start_position = start_position });\n    }\n\n    const result = findFirstValidTime(discs.items);\n    try std.io.getStdOut().writer().print(\"The first valid time is: {d}\\n\", .{result});\n}\n\nfn findFirstValidTime(discs: []const Disc) u32 {\n    var time: u32 = 0;\n    while (true) : (time += 1) {\n        var valid = true;\n        for (discs, 0..) |disc, i| {\n            const position = (disc.start_position + time + i + 1) % disc.positions;\n            if (position != 0) {\n                valid = false;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (valid) {\n            return time;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n"}]}

Unfortunately, you've run out of keys in your one-time pad, and so you need to generate some more.\n\nTo generate keys, you first get a stream of random data by taking the MD5 of a pre-arranged salt (your puzzle input) and an increasing integer index (starting with 0, and represented in decimal); the resulting MD5 hash should be represented as a string of lowercase hexadecimal digits.\n\nHowever, not all of these MD5 hashes are keys, and you need 64 new keys for your one-time pad. A hash is a key only if:\n\nIt contains three of the same character in a row, like 777. Only consider the first such triplet in a hash.\nOne of the next 1000 hashes in the stream contains that same character five times in a row, like 77777.\nConsidering future hashes for five-of-a-kind sequences does not cause those hashes to be skipped; instead, regardless of whether the current hash is a key, always resume testing for keys starting with the very next hash.\n\nFor example, if the pre-arranged salt is abc:\n\nThe first index which produces a triple is 18, because the MD5 hash of abc18 contains ...cc38887a5.... However, index 18 does not count as a key for your one-time pad, because none of the next thousand hashes (index 19 through index 1018) contain 88888.\nThe next index which produces a triple is 39; the hash of abc39 contains eee. It is also the first key: one of the next thousand hashes (the one at index 816) contains eeeee.\nNone of the next six triples are keys, but the one after that, at index 92, is: it contains 999 and index 200 contains 99999.\nEventually, index 22728 meets all of the criteria to generate the 64th key.\nSo, using our example salt of abc, index 22728 produces the 64th key.\n\nGiven the actual salt in your puzzle input, what index produces your 64th one-time pad key?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst Md5 = std.crypto.hash.Md5;\n\nfn getMD5Hash(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, input: []const u8) ![]u8 {\n    var hash: [Md5.digest_length]u8 = undefined;\n    Md5.hash(input, &hash, .{});\n    return try std.fmt.allocPrint(allocator, \"{x}\", .{std.fmt.fmtSliceHexLower(&hash)});\n}\n\nfn findTriplet(hash: []const u8) ?u8 {\n    for (0..hash.len - 2) |i| {\n        if (hash[i] == hash[i + 1] and hash[i] == hash[i + 2]) {\n            return hash[i];\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    const salt = try file.readToEndAlloc(allocator, 1024);\n    defer allocator.free(salt);\n\n    var keys: usize = 0;\n    var index: usize = 0;\n    var cache = std.AutoHashMap(usize, []u8).init(allocator);\n    defer {\n        var it = cache.valueIterator();\n        while (it.next()) |value| {\n            allocator.free(value.*);\n        }\n        cache.deinit();\n    }\n\n    while (keys < 64) : (index += 1) {\n        const input = try std.fmt.allocPrint(allocator, \"{s}{d}\", .{ salt, index });\n        defer allocator.free(input);\n\n        const hash = try getMD5Hash(allocator, input);\n        defer allocator.free(hash);\n\n        if (findTriplet(hash)) |triplet| {\n            const target = [_]u8{triplet} ** 5;\n            for (1..1001) |i| {\n                const next_index = index + i;\n                const next_hash = if (cache.get(next_index)) |h|\n                    h\n                else blk: {\n                    const next_input = try std.fmt.allocPrint(allocator, \"{s}{d}\", .{ salt, next_index });\n                    defer allocator.free(next_input);\n                    const h = try getMD5Hash(allocator, next_input);\n                    try cache.put(next_index, h);\n                    break :blk h;\n                };\n\n                if (std.mem.indexOf(u8, next_hash, &target) != null) {\n                    keys += 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{index - 1});\n}\n```\n"}]}

There are some radiation warnings and a big sign which reads \"Radioisotope Testing Facility\".\n\nAccording to the project status board, this facility is currently being used to experiment with Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs, or simply \"generators\") that are designed to be paired with specially-constructed microchips. Basically, an RTG is a highly radioactive rock that generates electricity through heat.\n\nThe experimental RTGs have poor radiation containment, so they're dangerously radioactive. The chips are prototypes and don't have normal radiation shielding, but they do have the ability to generate an electromagnetic radiation shield when powered. Unfortunately, they can only be powered by their corresponding RTG. An RTG powering a microchip is still dangerous to other microchips.\n\nIn other words, if a chip is ever left in the same area as another RTG, and it's not connected to its own RTG, the chip will be fried. Therefore, it is assumed that you will follow procedure and keep chips connected to their corresponding RTG when they're in the same room, and away from other RTGs otherwise.\n\nThese microchips sound very interesting and useful to your current activities, and you'd like to try to retrieve them. The fourth floor of the facility has an assembling machine which can make a self-contained, shielded computer for you to take with you - that is, if you can bring it all of the RTGs and microchips.\n\nWithin the radiation-shielded part of the facility (in which it's safe to have these pre-assembly RTGs), there is an elevator that can move between the four floors. Its capacity rating means it can carry at most yourself and two RTGs or microchips in any combination. (They're rigged to some heavy diagnostic equipment - the assembling machine will detach it for you.) As a security measure, the elevator will only function if it contains at least one RTG or microchip. The elevator always stops on each floor to recharge, and this takes long enough that the items within it and the items on that floor can irradiate each other. (You can prevent this if a Microchip and its Generator end up on the same floor in this way, as they can be connected while the elevator is recharging.)\n\nYou make some notes of the locations of each component of interest (your puzzle input). Before you don a hazmat suit and start moving things around, you'd like to have an idea of what you need to do.\n\nWhen you enter the containment area, you and the elevator will start on the first floor.\n\nFor example, suppose the isolated area has the following arrangement:\n\nThe first floor contains a hydrogen-compatible microchip and a lithium-compatible microchip.\nThe second floor contains a hydrogen generator.\nThe third floor contains a lithium generator.\nThe fourth floor contains nothing relevant.\nAs a diagram (F# for a Floor number, E for Elevator, H for Hydrogen, L for Lithium, M for Microchip, and G for Generator), the initial state looks like this:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 .  .  .  LG .  \nF2 .  HG .  .  .  \nF1 E  .  HM .  LM \nThen, to get everything up to the assembling machine on the fourth floor, the following steps could be taken:\n\nBring the Hydrogen-compatible Microchip to the second floor, which is safe because it can get power from the Hydrogen Generator:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 .  .  .  LG .  \nF2 E  HG HM .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  LM \nBring both Hydrogen-related items to the third floor, which is safe because the Hydrogen-compatible microchip is getting power from its generator:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 E  HG HM LG .  \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  LM \nLeave the Hydrogen Generator on floor three, but bring the Hydrogen-compatible Microchip back down with you so you can still use the elevator:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 .  HG .  LG .  \nF2 E  .  HM .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  LM \nAt the first floor, grab the Lithium-compatible Microchip, which is safe because Microchips don't affect each other:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 .  HG .  LG .  \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 E  .  HM .  LM \nBring both Microchips up one floor, where there is nothing to fry them:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 .  HG .  LG .  \nF2 E  .  HM .  LM \nF1 .  .  .  .  .  \nBring both Microchips up again to floor three, where they can be temporarily connected to their corresponding generators while the elevator recharges, preventing either of them from being fried:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 E  HG HM LG LM \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  .  \nBring both Microchips to the fourth floor:\n\nF4 E  .  HM .  LM \nF3 .  HG .  LG .  \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  .  \nLeave the Lithium-compatible microchip on the fourth floor, but bring the Hydrogen-compatible one so you can still use the elevator; this is safe because although the Lithium Generator is on the destination floor, you can connect Hydrogen-compatible microchip to the Hydrogen Generator there:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  LM \nF3 E  HG HM LG .  \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  .  \nBring both Generators up to the fourth floor, which is safe because you can connect the Lithium-compatible Microchip to the Lithium Generator upon arrival:\n\nF4 E  HG .

Sometimes, bots take microchips from \"input\" bins, too.\n\nInspecting one of the microchips, it seems like they each contain a single number; the bots must use some logic to decide what to do with each chip. You access the local control computer and download the bots' instructions (your puzzle input).\n\nSome of the instructions specify that a specific-valued microchip should be given to a specific bot; the rest of the instructions indicate what a given bot should do with its lower-value or higher-value chip.\n\nFor example, consider the following instructions:\n\nvalue 5 goes to bot 2\nbot 2 gives low to bot 1 and high to bot 0\nvalue 3 goes to bot 1\nbot 1 gives low to output 1 and high to bot 0\nbot 0 gives low to output 2 and high to output 0\nvalue 2 goes to bot 2\nInitially, bot 1 starts with a value-3 chip, and bot 2 starts with a value-2 chip and a value-5 chip.\nBecause bot 2 has two microchips, it gives its lower one (2) to bot 1 and its higher one (5) to bot 0.\nThen, bot 1 has two microchips; it puts the value-2 chip in output 1 and gives the value-3 chip to bot 0.\nFinally, bot 0 has two microchips; it puts the 3 in output 2 and the 5 in output 0.\nIn the end, output bin 0 contains a value-5 microchip, output bin 1 contains a value-2 microchip, and output bin 2 contains a value-3 microchip.

After briefly scanning it for interesting files, you find one file in particular that catches your attention. It's compressed with an experimental format, but fortunately, the documentation for the format is nearby.\n\nThe format compresses a sequence of characters. Whitespace is ignored.

The marker itself is not included in the decompressed output.\n\nIf parentheses or other characters appear within the data referenced by a marker, that's okay - treat it like normal data, not a marker, and then resume looking for markers after the decompressed section.\n\nFor example:\n\nADVENT contains no markers and decompresses to itself with no changes, resulting in a decompressed length of 6.\nA(1x5)BC repeats only the B a total of 5 times, becoming ABBBBBC for a decompressed length of 7.\n(3x3)XYZ becomes XYZXYZXYZ for a decompressed length of 9.\nA(2x2)BCD(2x2)EFG doubles the BC and EF, becoming ABCBCDEFEFG for a decompressed length of 11.\n(6x1)(1x3)A simply becomes (1x3)A - the (1x3) looks like a marker, but because it's within a data section of another marker, it is not treated any differently from the A that comes after it. It has a decompressed length of 6.\nX(8x2)(3x3)ABCY becomes X(3x3)ABC(3x3)ABCY (for a decompressed length of 18), because the decompressed data from the (8x2) marker (the (3x3)ABC) is skipped and not processed further.\nWhat is the decompressed length of the file (your puzzle input)?

However, there's one small problem: he can't get the sleigh to balance. If it isn't balanced, he can't defy physics, and nobody gets presents this year.\n\nNo pressure.\n\nSanta has provided you a list of the weights of every package he needs to fit on the sleigh. The packages need to be split into three groups of exactly the same weight, and every package has to fit. The first group goes in the passenger compartment of the sleigh, and the second and third go in containers on either side. Only when all three groups weigh exactly the same amount will the sleigh be able to fly. Defying physics has rules, you know!\n\nOf course, that's not the only problem. The first group - the one going in the passenger compartment - needs as few packages as possible so that Santa has some legroom left over. It doesn't matter how many packages are in either of the other two groups, so long as all of the groups weigh the same.\n\nFurthermore, Santa tells you, if there are multiple ways to arrange the packages such that the fewest possible are in the first group, you need to choose the way where the first group has the smallest quantum entanglement to reduce the chance of any \"complications\". The quantum entanglement of a group of packages is the product of their weights, that is, the value you get when you multiply their weights together. Only consider quantum entanglement if the first group has the fewest possible number of packages in it and all groups weigh the same amount.\n\nFor example, suppose you have ten packages with weights 1 through 5 and 7 through 11. For this situation, some of the unique first groups, their quantum entanglements, and a way to divide the remaining packages are as follows:\n\nGroup 1;             Group 2; Group 3\n11 9       (QE= 99); 10 8 2;  7 5 4 3 1\n10 9 1     (QE= 90); 11 7 2;  8 5 4 3\n10 8 2     (QE=160); 11 9;    7 5 4 3 1\n10 7 3     (QE=210); 11 9;    8 5 4 2 1\n10 5 4 1   (QE=200); 11 9;    8 7 3 2\n10 5 3 2   (QE=300); 11 9;    8 7 4 1\n10 4 3 2 1 (QE=240); 11 9;    8 7 5\n9 8 3      (QE=216); 11 7 2;  10 5 4 1\n9 7 4      (QE=252); 11 8 1;  10 5 3 2\n9 5 4 2    (QE=360); 11 8 1;  10 7 3\n8 7 5      (QE=280); 11 9;    10 4 3 2 1\n8 5 4 3    (QE=480); 11 9;    10 7 2 1\n7 5 4 3 1  (QE=420); 11 9;    10 8 2\nOf these, although 10 9 1 has the smallest quantum entanglement (90), the configuration with only two packages, 11 9, in the passenger compartment gives Santa the most legroom and wins. In this situation, the quantum entanglement for the ideal configuration is therefore 99. Had there been two configurations with only two packages in the first group, the one with the smaller quantum entanglement would be chosen.\n\nWhat is the quantum entanglement of the first group of packages in the ideal configuration?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 10723906903.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThat's weird... the sleigh still isn't balancing.\n\n\"Ho ho ho\", Santa muses to himself. \"I forgot the trunk\".\n\nBalance the sleigh again, but this time, separate the packages into four groups instead of three. The other constraints still apply.\n\nGiven the example packages above, this would be some of the new unique first groups, their quantum entanglements, and one way to divide the remaining packages:\n\n\n11 4    (QE=44); 10 5;   9 3 2 1; 8 7\n10 5    (QE=50); 11 4;   9 3 2 1; 8 7\n9 5 1   (QE=45); 11 4;   10 3 2;  8 7\n9 4 2   (QE=72); 11 3 1; 10 5;    8 7\n9 3 2 1 (QE=54); 11 4;   10 5;    8 7\n8 7     (QE=56); 11 4;   10 5;    9 3 2 1\nOf these, there are three arrangements that put the minimum (two) number of packages in the first group: 11 4, 10 5, and 8 7. Of these, 11 4 has the lowest quantum entanglement, and so it is selected.\n\nNow, what is the quantum entanglement of the first group of packages in the ideal configuration?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst math = std.math;\nconst Allocator = std.mem.Allocator;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var buf_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n\n    var weights = std.ArrayList(u64).init(allocator);\n    defer weights.deinit();\n\n    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |line| {\n        const weight = try std.fmt.parseInt(u64, line, 10);\n        try weights.append(weight);\n    }\n\n    const total_weight = sum(weights.items);\n    const group_weight = total_weight / 4;\n\n    const result = try findIdealConfiguration(allocator, weights.items, group_weight);\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"{}\\n\", .{result});\n}\n\nfn sum(slice: []const u64) u64 {\n    var total: u64 = 0;\n    for (slice) |value| {\n        total += value;\n    }\n    return total;\n}\n\nfn findIdealConfiguration(allocator: Allocator, weights: []const u64, target_weight: u64) !u64 {\n    var min_size: usize = math.maxInt(usize);\n    var min_qe: u64 = math.maxInt(u64);\n\n    var combination = try allocator.alloc(bool, weights.len);\n    defer allocator.free(combination);\n    @memset(combination, false);\n\n    while (nextCombination(combination)) {\n        const group_sum = sumSelected(weights, combination);\n        if (group_sum == target_weight) {\n            const size = countSelected(combination);\n            if (size < min_size or (size == min_size and calculateQE(weights, combination) < min_qe)) {\n                min_size = size;\n                min_qe = calculateQE(weights, combination);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return min_qe;\n}\n\nfn nextCombination(combination: []bool) bool {\n    var i: usize = 0;\n    while (i < combination.len) : (i += 1) {\n        if (!combination[i]) {\n            combination[i] = true;\n            return true;\n        }\n        combination[i] = false;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\nfn sumSelected(weights: []const u64, combination: []const bool) u64 {\n    var summ: u64 = 0;\n    for (weights, combination) |weight, selected| {\n        if (selected) {\n            summ += weight;\n        }\n    }\n    return summ;\n}\n\nfn countSelected(combination: []const bool) usize {\n    var count: usize = 0;\n    for (combination) |selected| {\n        if (selected) {\n            count += 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\nfn calculateQE(weights: []const u64, combination: []const bool) u64 {\n    var qe: u64 = 1;\n    for (weights, combination) |weight, selected| {\n        if (selected) {\n            qe *= weight;\n        }\n    }\n    return qe;\n}\n```\n"}]}

It doesn't matter how many packages are in either of the other two groups, so long as all of the groups weigh the same.\n\nFurthermore, Santa tells you, if there are multiple ways to arrange the packages such that the fewest possible are in the first group, you need to choose the way where the first group has the smallest quantum entanglement to reduce the chance of any \"complications\". The quantum entanglement of a group of packages is the product of their weights, that is, the value you get when you multiply their weights together. Only consider quantum entanglement if the first group has the fewest possible number of packages in it and all groups weigh the same amount.\n\nFor example, suppose you have ten packages with weights 1 through 5 and 7 through 11. For this situation, some of the unique first groups, their quantum entanglements, and a way to divide the remaining packages are as follows:\n\nGroup 1;             Group 2; Group 3\n11 9       (QE= 99); 10 8 2;  7 5 4 3 1\n10 9 1     (QE= 90); 11 7 2;  8 5 4 3\n10 8 2     (QE=160); 11 9;    7 5 4 3 1\n10 7 3     (QE=210); 11 9;    8 5 4 2 1\n10 5 4 1   (QE=200); 11 9;    8 7 3 2\n10 5 3 2   (QE=300); 11 9;    8 7 4 1\n10 4 3 2 1 (QE=240); 11 9;    8 7 5\n9 8 3      (QE=216); 11 7 2;  10 5 4 1\n9 7 4      (QE=252); 11 8 1;  10 5 3 2\n9 5 4 2    (QE=360); 11 8 1;  10 7 3\n8 7 5      (QE=280); 11 9;    10 4 3 2 1\n8 5 4 3    (QE=480); 11 9;    10 7 2 1\n7 5 4 3 1  (QE=420); 11 9;    10 8 2\nOf these, although 10 9 1 has the smallest quantum entanglement (90), the configuration with only two packages, 11 9, in the passenger compartment gives Santa the most legroom and wins. In this situation, the quantum entanglement for the ideal configuration is therefore 99. Had there been two configurations with only two packages in the first group, the one with the smaller quantum entanglement would be chosen.\n\nWhat is the quantum entanglement of the first group of packages in the ideal configuration?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst math = std.math;\nconst Allocator = std.mem.Allocator;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var buf_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n\n    var weights = std.ArrayList(u64).init(allocator);\n    defer weights.deinit();\n\n    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |line| {\n        const weight = try std.fmt.parseInt(u64, line, 10);\n        try weights.append(weight);\n    }\n\n    const total_weight = sum(weights.items);\n    const group_weight = total_weight / 3;\n\n    const result = try findIdealConfiguration(allocator, weights.items, group_weight);\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"Quantum entanglement: {}\\n\", .{result});\n}\n\nfn sum(slice: []const u64) u64 {\n    var total: u64 = 0;\n    for (slice) |num| {\n        total += num;\n    }\n    return total;\n}\n\nfn findIdealConfiguration(allocator: Allocator, weights: []const u64, target_weight: u64) !u64 {\n    var min_packages: usize = math.maxInt(usize);\n    var min_entanglement: u64 = math.maxInt(u64);\n\n    var combination = try allocator.alloc(bool, weights.len);\n    defer allocator.free(combination);\n\n    var i: usize = 1;\n    while (i <= weights.len) : (i += 1) {\n        try generateCombinations(allocator, weights, target_weight, combination, 0, i, 0, &min_packages, &min_entanglement);\n        if (min_entanglement != math.maxInt(u64)) {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return min_entanglement;\n}\n\nfn generateCombinations(\n    allocator: Allocator,\n    weights: []const u64,\n    target_weight: u64,\n    combination: []bool,\n    start: usize,\n    len: usize,\n    index: usize,\n    min_packages: *usize,\n    min_entanglement: *u64,\n) !void {\n    if (index == len) {\n        var group_weight: u64 = 0;\n        var group_size: usize = 0;\n        var entanglement: u64 = 1;\n\n        for (combination, 0..) |selected, i| {\n            if (selected) {\n                group_weight += weights[i];\n                group_size += 1;\n                entanglement *= weights[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (group_weight == target_weight and group_size <= min_packages.*) {\n            if (group_size < min_packages.*) {\n                min_packages.* = group_size;\n                min_entanglement.* = entanglement;\n            } else if (entanglement < min_entanglement.*) {\n                min_entanglement.* = entanglement;\n            }\n        }\n        return;\n    }\n\n    var i = start;\n    while (i < weights.len) : (i += 1) {\n        combination[i] = true;\n        try generateCombinations(allocator, weights, target_weight, combination, i + 1, len, index + 1, min_packages, min_entanglement);\n        combination[i] = false;\n    }\n}\n```\n"}]}

Now he's playing the game with a wizard. Of course, he gets stuck on another boss and needs your help again.\n\nIn this version, combat still proceeds with the player and the boss taking alternating turns. The player still goes first. Now, however, you don't get any equipment; instead, you must choose one of your spells to cast. The first character at or below 0 hit points loses.\n\nSince you're a wizard, you don't get to wear armor, and you can't attack normally. However, since you do magic damage, your opponent's armor is ignored, and so the boss effectively has zero armor as well. As before, if armor (from a spell, in this case) would reduce damage below 1, it becomes 1 instead - that is, the boss' attacks always deal at least 1 damage.\n\nOn each of your turns, you must select one of your spells to cast. If you cannot afford to cast any spell, you lose. Spells cost mana; you start with 500 mana, but have no maximum limit. You must have enough mana to cast a spell, and its cost is immediately deducted when you cast it. Your spells are Magic Missile, Drain, Shield, Poison, and Recharge.\n\nMagic Missile costs 53 mana. It instantly does 4 damage.\nDrain costs 73 mana. It instantly does 2 damage and heals you for 2 hit points.\nShield costs 113 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 6 turns. While it is active, your armor is increased by 7.\nPoison costs 173 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 6 turns. At the start of each turn while it is active, it deals the boss 3 damage.\nRecharge costs 229 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 5 turns. At the start of each turn while it is active, it gives you 101 new mana.\nEffects all work the same way. Effects apply at the start of both the player's turns and the boss' turns. Effects are created with a timer (the number of turns they last); at the start of each turn, after they apply any effect they have, their timer is decreased by one. If this decreases the timer to zero, the effect ends. You cannot cast a spell that would start an effect which is already active. However, effects can be started on the same turn they end.\n\nFor example, suppose the player has 10 hit points and 250 mana, and that the boss has 13 hit points and 8 damage:\n\n-- Player turn --\n- Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 250 mana\n- Boss has 13 hit points\nPlayer casts Poison.\n\n-- Boss turn --\n- Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 77 mana\n- Boss has 13 hit points\nPoison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 5.\nBoss attacks for 8 damage.\n\n-- Player turn --\n- Player has 2 hit points, 0 armor, 77 mana\n- Boss has 10 hit points\nPoison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 4.\nPlayer casts Magic Missile, dealing 4 damage.\n\n-- Boss turn --\n- Player has 2 hit points, 0 armor, 24 mana\n- Boss has 3 hit points\nPoison deals 3 damage. This kills the boss, and the player wins.\nNow, suppose the same initial conditions, except that the boss has 14 hit points instead:\n\n-- Player turn --\n- Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 250 mana\n- Boss has 14 hit points\nPlayer casts Recharge.\n\n-- Boss turn --\n- Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 21 mana\n- Boss has 14 hit points\nRecharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 4.\nBoss attacks for 8 damage!\n\n-- Player turn --\n- Player has 2 hit points, 0 armor, 122 mana\n- Boss has 14 hit points\nRecharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 3.\nPlayer casts Shield, increasing armor by 7.\n\n-- Boss turn --\n- Player has 2 hit points, 7 armor, 110 mana\n- Boss has 14 hit points\nShield's timer is now 5.\nRecharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 2.\nBoss attacks for 8 - 7 = 1 damage!\n\n-- Player turn --\n- Player has 1 hit point, 7 armor, 211 mana\n- Boss has 14 hit points\nShield's timer is now 4.\nRecharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 1.\nPlayer casts Drain, dealing 2 damage, and healing 2 hit points.\n\n-- Boss turn --\n- Player has 3 hit points, 7 armor, 239 mana\n- Boss has 12 hit points\nShield's timer is now 3.\nRecharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 0.\nRecharge wears off.\nBoss attacks for 8 - 7 = 1 damage!\n\n-- Player turn --\n- Player has 2 hit points, 7 armor, 340 mana\n- Boss has 12 hit points\nShield's timer is now 2.\nPlayer casts Poison.\n\n-- Boss turn --\n- Player has 2 hit points, 7 armor, 167 mana\n- Boss has 12 hit points\nShield's timer is now 1.\nPoison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 5.\nBoss attacks for 8 - 7 = 1 damage!\n\n-- Player turn --\n- Player has 1 hit point, 7 armor, 167 mana\n- Boss has 9 hit points\nShield's timer is now 0.\nShield wears off, decreasing armor by 7.\nPoison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 4.\nPlayer casts Magic Missile, dealing 4 damage.\n\n-- Boss turn --\n- Player has 1 hit point, 0 armor, 114 mana\n- Boss has 2 hit points\nPoison deals 3 damage. This kills the boss, and the player wins.\nYou start with 50 hit points and 500 mana points. The boss's actual stats are in your puzzle input.

It's an RPG, and he's stuck on a boss. He needs to know what equipment to buy at the shop. He hands you the controller.\n\nIn this game, the player (you) and the enemy (the boss) take turns attacking. The player always goes first. Each attack reduces the opponent's hit points by at least 1. The first character at or below 0 hit points loses.\n\nDamage dealt by an attacker each turn is equal to the attacker's damage score minus the defender's armor score. An attacker always does at least 1 damage. So, if the attacker has a damage score of 8, and the defender has an armor score of 3, the defender loses 5 hit points. If the defender had an armor score of 300, the defender would still lose 1 hit point.\n\nYour damage score and armor score both start at zero. They can be increased by buying items in exchange for gold. You start with no items and have as much gold as you need. Your total damage or armor is equal to the sum of those stats from all of your items. You have 100 hit points.\n\nHere is what the item shop is selling:\n\nWeapons:    Cost  Damage  Armor\nDagger        8     4       0\nShortsword   10     5       0\nWarhammer    25     6       0\nLongsword    40     7       0\nGreataxe     74     8       0\n\nArmor:      Cost  Damage  Armor\nLeather      13     0       1\nChainmail    31     0       2\nSplintmail   53     0       3\nBandedmail   75     0       4\nPlatemail   102     0       5\n\nRings:      Cost  Damage  Armor\nDamage +1    25     1       0\nDamage +2    50     2       0\nDamage +3   100     3       0\nDefense +1   20     0       1\nDefense +2   40     0       2\nDefense +3   80     0       3\nYou must buy exactly one weapon; no dual-wielding. Armor is optional, but you can't use more than one. You can buy 0-2 rings (at most one for each hand). You must use any items you buy. The shop only has one of each item, so you can't buy, for example, two rings of Damage +3.\n\nFor example, suppose you have 8 hit points, 5 damage, and 5 armor, and that the boss has 12 hit points, 7 damage, and 2 armor:\n\nThe player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 9 hit points.\nThe boss deals 7-5 = 2 damage; the player goes down to 6 hit points.\nThe player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 6 hit points.\nThe boss deals 7-5 = 2 damage; the player goes down to 4 hit points.\nThe player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 3 hit points.\nThe boss deals 7-5 = 2 damage; the player goes down to 2 hit points.\nThe player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 0 hit points.\nIn this scenario, the player wins!

His nose isn't shining very brightly, and he needs medicine.\n\nRed-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is going to need custom-made medicine. Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry isn't similar to regular reindeer chemistry, either.\n\nThe North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant, capable of constructing any Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need. It works by starting with some input molecule and then doing a series of replacements, one per step, until it has the right molecule.\n\nHowever, the machine has to be calibrated before it can be used. Calibration involves determining the number of molecules that can be generated in one step from a given starting point.\n\nFor example, imagine a simpler machine that supports only the following replacements:\n\nH => HO\nH => OH\nO => HH\nGiven the replacements above and starting with HOH, the following molecules could be generated:\n\nHOOH (via H => HO on the first H).\nHOHO (via H => HO on the second H).\nOHOH (via H => OH on the first H).\nHOOH (via H => OH on the second H).\nHHHH (via O => HH).\nSo, in the example above, there are 4 distinct molecules (not five, because HOOH appears twice) after one replacement from HOH. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can become 7 distinct molecules (over nine replacements: six from H, and three from O).\n\nThe machine replaces without regard for the surrounding characters. For example, given the string H2O, the transition H => OO would result in OO2O.\n\nYour puzzle input describes all of the possible replacements and, at the bottom, the medicine molecule for which you need to calibrate the machine. How many distinct molecules can be created after all the different ways you can do one replacement on the medicine molecule?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 509.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow that the machine is calibrated, you're ready to begin molecule fabrication.\n\nMolecule fabrication always begins with just a single electron, e, and applying replacements one at a time, just like the ones during calibration.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following replacements:\n\ne => H\ne => O\nH => HO\nH => OH\nO => HH\nIf you'd like to make HOH, you start with e, and then make the following replacements:\n\ne => O to get O\nO => HH to get HH\nH => OH (on the second H) to get HOH\nSo, you could make HOH after 3 steps. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can be made in 6 steps.\n\nHow long will it take to make the medicine?

Lights on the edge of the grid might have fewer than eight neighbors; the missing ones always count as \"off\".\n\nFor example, in a simplified 6x6 grid, the light marked A has the neighbors numbered 1 through 8, and the light marked B, which is on an edge, only has the neighbors marked 1 through 5:\n\n1B5...\n234...\n......\n..123.\n..8A4.\n..765.\nThe state a light should have next is based on its current state (on or off) plus the number of neighbors that are on:\n\nA light which is on stays on when 2 or 3 neighbors are on, and turns off otherwise.\nA light which is off turns on if exactly 3 neighbors are on, and stays off otherwise.\nAll of the lights update simultaneously; they all consider the same current state before moving to the next.\n\nHere's a few steps from an example configuration of another 6x6 grid:\n\nInitial state:\n.#.#.#\n...##.\n#....#\n..#...\n#.#..#\n####..\n\nAfter 1 step:\n..##..\n..##.#\n...##.\n......\n#.....\n#.##..\n\nAfter 2 steps:\n..###.\n......\n..###.\n......\n.#....\n.#....\n\nAfter 3 steps:\n...#..\n......\n...#..\n..##..\n......\n......\n\nAfter 4 steps:\n......\n......\n..##..\n..##..\n......\n......\nAfter 4 steps, this example has four lights on.\n\nIn your grid of 100x100 lights, given your initial configuration, how many lights are on after 100 steps?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nconst GRID_SIZE = 100;\nconst STEPS = 100;\n\nconst Grid = [GRID_SIZE][GRID_SIZE]bool;\n\nfn countNeighbors(grid: Grid, x: usize, y: usize) u8 {\n    var count: u8 = 0;\n    const start_x = if (x == 0) 0 else x - 1;\n    const end_x = if (x == GRID_SIZE - 1) x else x + 1;\n    const start_y = if (y == 0) 0 else y - 1;\n    const end_y = if (y == GRID_SIZE - 1) y else y + 1;\n\n    var i = start_x;\n    while (i <= end_x) : (i += 1) {\n        var j = start_y;\n        while (j <= end_y) : (j += 1) {\n            if (i == x and j == y) continue;\n            if (grid[i][j]) count += 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\nfn simulateStep(grid: *Grid) void {\n    var new_grid: Grid = undefined;\n\n    for (grid, 0..) |row, x| {\n        for (row, 0..) |light, y| {\n            const neighbors = countNeighbors(grid.*, x, y);\n            new_grid[x][y] = if (light) \n                (neighbors == 2 or neighbors == 3)\n            else\n                (neighbors == 3);\n        }\n    }\n\n    grid.* = new_grid;\n}\n\nfn countLightsOn(grid: Grid) usize {\n    var count: usize = 0;\n    for (grid) |row| {\n        for (row) |light| {\n            if (light) count += 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var buf_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n\n    var grid: Grid = undefined;\n\n    var y: usize = 0;\n    var buf: [GRID_SIZE + 1]u8 = undefined;\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |line| : (y += 1) {\n        for (line, 0..) |char, x| {\n            grid[y][x] = char == '#';\n        }\n    }\n\n    var step: usize = 0;\n    while (step < STEPS) : (step += 1) {\n        simulateStep(&grid);\n    }\n\n    const lights_on = countLightsOn(grid);\n\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"Number of lights on after {} steps: {}\\n\", .{ STEPS, lights_on });\n}\n```\n"}]}

All you have to do is find the right balance of ingredients.\n\nYour recipe leaves room for exactly 100 teaspoons of ingredients. You make a list of the remaining ingredients you could use to finish the recipe (your puzzle input) and their properties per teaspoon:\n\ncapacity (how well it helps the cookie absorb milk)\ndurability (how well it keeps the cookie intact when full of milk)\nflavor (how tasty it makes the cookie)\ntexture (how it improves the feel of the cookie)\ncalories (how many calories it adds to the cookie)\nYou can only measure ingredients in whole-teaspoon amounts accurately, and you have to be accurate so you can reproduce your results in the future. The total score of a cookie can be found by adding up each of the properties (negative totals become 0) and then multiplying together everything except calories.\n\nFor instance, suppose you have these two ingredients:\n\nButterscotch: capacity -1, durability -2, flavor 6, texture 3, calories 8\nCinnamon: capacity 2, durability 3, flavor -2, texture -1, calories 3\nThen, choosing to use 44 teaspoons of butterscotch and 56 teaspoons of cinnamon (because the amounts of each ingredient must add up to 100) would result in a cookie with the following properties:\n\nA capacity of 44*-1 + 56*2 = 68\nA durability of 44*-2 + 56*3 = 80\nA flavor of 44*6 + 56*-2 = 152\nA texture of 44*3 + 56*-1 = 76\nMultiplying these together (68 * 80 * 152 * 76, ignoring calories for now) results in a total score of 62842880, which happens to be the best score possible given these ingredients. If any properties had produced a negative total, it would have instead become zero, causing the whole score to multiply to zero.\n\nGiven the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 13882464.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nYour cookie recipe becomes wildly popular! Someone asks if you can make another recipe that has exactly 500 calories per cookie (so they can use it as a meal replacement). Keep the rest of your award-winning process the same (100 teaspoons, same ingredients, same scoring system).\n\nFor example, given the ingredients above, if you had instead selected 40 teaspoons of butterscotch and 60 teaspoons of cinnamon (which still adds to 100), the total calorie count would be 40*8 + 60*3 = 500. The total score would go down, though: only 57600000, the best you can do in such trying circumstances.\n\nGiven the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make with a calorie total of 500?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nconst Ingredient = struct {\n    name: []const u8,\n    capacity: i32,\n    durability: i32,\n    flavor: i32,\n    texture: i32,\n    calories: i32,\n};\n\nfn calculateScore(ingredients: []const Ingredient, amounts: []const u32) u64 {\n    var capacity: i32 = 0;\n    var durability: i32 = 0;\n    var flavor: i32 = 0;\n    var texture: i32 = 0;\n    var calories: i32 = 0;\n\n    for (ingredients, amounts) |ingredient, amount| {\n        capacity += ingredient.capacity * @as(i32, @intCast(amount));\n        durability += ingredient.durability * @as(i32, @intCast(amount));\n        flavor += ingredient.flavor * @as(i32, @intCast(amount));\n        texture += ingredient.texture * @as(i32, @intCast(amount));\n        calories += ingredient.calories * @as(i32, @intCast(amount));\n    }\n\n    if (capacity <= 0 or durability <= 0 or flavor <= 0 or texture <= 0 or calories != 500) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    return @as(u64, @intCast(capacity)) * @as(u64, @intCast(durability)) * @as(u64, @intCast(flavor)) * @as(u64, @intCast(texture));\n}\n\nfn findBestScore(ingredients: []const Ingredient, amounts: []u32, index: usize, remaining: u32) u64 {\n    if (index == ingredients.len - 1) {\n        amounts[index] = remaining;\n        return calculateScore(ingredients, amounts);\n    }\n\n    var best_score: u64 = 0;\n    var i: u32 = 0;\n    while (i <= remaining) : (i += 1) {\n        amounts[index] = i;\n        const score = findBestScore(ingredients, amounts, index + 1, remaining - i);\n        if (score > best_score) {\n            best_score = score;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return best_score;\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var buf_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n\n    var ingredients = std.ArrayList(Ingredient).init(allocator);\n    defer ingredients.deinit();\n\n    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |line| {\n        var parts = std.mem.split(u8, line, \": \");\n        const name = parts.next().?;\n        const properties = parts.next().?;\n\n        var props = std.mem.split(u8, properties, \", \");\n        const capacity = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, props.next().?[9..], 10);\n        const durability = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, props.next().?[11..], 10);\n        const flavor = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, props.next().?[7..], 10);\n        const texture = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, props.next().?[8..], 10);\n        const calories = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, props.next().?[9..], 10);\n\n        try ingredients.append(Ingredient{\n            .name = try allocator.dupe(u8, name),\n            .capacity = capacity,\n            .durability = durability,\n            .flavor = flavor,\n            .texture = texture,\n            .calories = calories,\n        });\n    }\n\n    var amounts = try allocator.alloc(u32, ingredients.items.len);\n    defer allocator.free(amounts);\n\n    const best_score = findBestScore(ingredients.items, amounts, 0, 100);\n\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"The highest-scoring cookie with exactly 500 calories has a score of {}\\n\", .{best_score});\n\n    for (ingredients.items) |ingredient| {\n        allocator.free(ingredient.name);\n    }\n}\n```\n"}]}

If any properties had produced a negative total, it would have instead become zero, causing the whole score to multiply to zero.\n\nGiven the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nconst Ingredient = struct {\n    name: []const u8,\n    capacity: i32,\n    durability: i32,\n    flavor: i32,\n    texture: i32,\n    calories: i32,\n};\n\nfn calculateScore(ingredients: []const Ingredient, amounts: []const u32) u64 {\n    var capacity: i32 = 0;\n    var durability: i32 = 0;\n    var flavor: i32 = 0;\n    var texture: i32 = 0;\n\n    for (ingredients, amounts) |ingredient, amount| {\n        capacity += ingredient.capacity * @as(i32, @intCast(amount));\n        durability += ingredient.durability * @as(i32, @intCast(amount));\n        flavor += ingredient.flavor * @as(i32, @intCast(amount));\n        texture += ingredient.texture * @as(i32, @intCast(amount));\n    }\n\n    if (capacity <= 0 or durability <= 0 or flavor <= 0 or texture <= 0) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    return @as(u64, @intCast(capacity)) * @as(u64, @intCast(durability)) * @as(u64, @intCast(flavor)) * @as(u64, @intCast(texture));\n}\n\nfn findBestScore(ingredients: []const Ingredient, amounts: []u32, index: usize, remaining: u32) u64 {\n    if (index == ingredients.len - 1) {\n        amounts[index] = remaining;\n        return calculateScore(ingredients, amounts);\n    }\n\n    var best_score: u64 = 0;\n    var i: u32 = 0;\n    while (i <= remaining) : (i += 1) {\n        amounts[index] = i;\n        const score = findBestScore(ingredients, amounts, index + 1, remaining - i);\n        if (score > best_score) {\n            best_score = score;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return best_score;\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var buf_reader = std.io.bufferedReader(file.reader());\n    var in_stream = buf_reader.reader();\n\n    var ingredients = std.ArrayList(Ingredient).init(allocator);\n    defer ingredients.deinit();\n\n    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    while (try in_stream.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(&buf, '\\n')) |line| {\n        var parts = std.mem.split(u8, line, \": \");\n        const name = parts.next().?;\n        const properties = parts.next().?;\n\n        var props = std.mem.split(u8, properties, \", \");\n        const capacity = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, props.next().?[9..], 10);\n        const durability = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, props.next().?[11..], 10);\n        const flavor = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, props.next().?[7..], 10);\n        const texture = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, props.next().?[8..], 10);\n        const calories = try std.fmt.parseInt(i32, props.next().?[9..], 10);\n\n        try ingredients.append(Ingredient{\n            .name = try allocator.dupe(u8, name),\n            .capacity = capacity,\n            .durability = durability,\n            .flavor = flavor,\n            .texture = texture,\n            .calories = calories,\n        });\n    }\n\n    var amounts = try allocator.alloc(u32, ingredients.items.len);\n    defer allocator.free(amounts);\n\n    const best_score = findBestScore(ingredients.items, amounts, 0, 100);\n\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"The highest-scoring cookie has a score of {}\\n\", .{best_score});\n\n    for (ingredients.items) |ingredient| {\n        allocator.free(ingredient.name);\n    }\n}\n```\n"}]}

Reindeer can fly at high speeds, but must rest occasionally to recover their energy. Santa would like to know which of his reindeer is fastest, and so he has them race.\n\nReindeer can only either be flying (always at their top speed) or resting (not moving at all), and always spend whole seconds in either state.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following Reindeer:\n\nComet can fly 14 km/s for 10 seconds, but then must rest for 127 seconds.\nDancer can fly 16 km/s for 11 seconds, but then must rest for 162 seconds.\nAfter one second, Comet has gone 14 km, while Dancer has gone 16 km. After ten seconds, Comet has gone 140 km, while Dancer has gone 160 km. On the eleventh second, Comet begins resting (staying at 140 km), and Dancer continues on for a total distance of 176 km. On the 12th second, both reindeer are resting. They continue to rest until the 138th second, when Comet flies for another ten seconds. On the 174th second, Dancer flies for another 11 seconds.\n\nIn this example, after the 1000th second, both reindeer are resting, and Comet is in the lead at 1120 km (poor Dancer has only gotten 1056 km by that point). So, in this situation, Comet would win (if the race ended at 1000 seconds).\n\nGiven the descriptions of each reindeer (in your puzzle input), after exactly 2503 seconds, what distance has the winning reindeer traveled?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 2696.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nSeeing how reindeer move in bursts, Santa decides he's not pleased with the old scoring system.\n\nInstead, at the end of each second, he awards one point to the reindeer currently in the lead. (If there are multiple reindeer tied for the lead, they each get one point.) He keeps the traditional 2503 second time limit, of course, as doing otherwise would be entirely ridiculous.\n\nGiven the example reindeer from above, after the first second, Dancer is in the lead and gets one point. He stays in the lead until several seconds into Comet's second burst: after the 140th second, Comet pulls into the lead and gets his first point. Of course, since Dancer had been in the lead for the 139 seconds before that, he has accumulated 139 points by the 140th second.\n\nAfter the 1000th second, Dancer has accumulated 689 points, while poor Comet, our old champion, only has 312.

You're going to find the optimal seating arrangement and avoid all those awkward conversations.\n\nYou start by writing up a list of everyone invited and the amount their happiness would increase or decrease if they were to find themselves sitting next to each other person. You have a circular table that will be just big enough to fit everyone comfortably, and so each person will have exactly two neighbors.\n\nFor example, suppose you have only four attendees planned, and you calculate their potential happiness as follows:\n\nAlice would gain 54 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.\nAlice would lose 79 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.\nAlice would lose 2 happiness units by sitting next to David.\nBob would gain 83 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.\nBob would lose 7 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.\nBob would lose 63 happiness units by sitting next to David.\nCarol would lose 62 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.\nCarol would gain 60 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.\nCarol would gain 55 happiness units by sitting next to David.\nDavid would gain 46 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.\nDavid would lose 7 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.\nDavid would gain 41 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.\nThen, if you seat Alice next to David, Alice would lose 2 happiness units (because David talks so much), but David would gain 46 happiness units (because Alice is such a good listener), for a total change of 44.\n\nIf you continue around the table, you could then seat Bob next to Alice (Bob gains 83, Alice gains 54). Finally, seat Carol, who sits next to Bob (Carol gains 60, Bob loses 7) and David (Carol gains 55, David gains 41).

Finally, seat Carol, who sits next to Bob (Carol gains 60, Bob loses 7) and David (Carol gains 55, David gains 41).

They cannot skip letters; abd doesn't count.\nPasswords may not contain the letters i, o, or l, as these letters can be mistaken for other characters and are therefore confusing.\nPasswords must contain at least two different, non-overlapping pairs of letters, like aa, bb, or zz.\nFor example:\n\nhijklmmn meets the first requirement (because it contains the straight hij) but fails the second requirement requirement (because it contains i and l).\nabbceffg meets the third requirement (because it repeats bb and ff) but fails the first requirement.\nabbcegjk fails the third requirement, because it only has one double letter (bb).\nThe next password after abcdefgh is abcdffaa.\nThe next password after ghijklmn is ghjaabcc, because you eventually skip all the passwords that start with ghi..., since i is not allowed.\nGiven Santa's current password (your puzzle input), what should his next password be?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nconst PASSWORD_LENGTH = 8;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    // Read input from file\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(\"input.txt\", .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    const content = try file.readToEndAlloc(allocator, 1024);\n    defer allocator.free(content);\n\n    var password = try allocator.alloc(u8, PASSWORD_LENGTH);\n    defer allocator.free(password);\n    @memcpy(password, std.mem.trim(u8, content, &std.ascii.whitespace));\n\n    while (true) {\n        incrementPassword(password);\n        if (isValidPassword(password)) break;\n    }\n\n    try std.io.getStdOut().writer().print(\"{s}\\n\", .{password});\n}\n\nfn incrementPassword(password: []u8) void {\n    var i: usize = PASSWORD_LENGTH;\n    while (i > 0) {\n        i -= 1;\n        if (password[i] == 'z') {\n            password[i] = 'a';\n        } else {\n            password[i] += 1;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn isValidPassword(password: []const u8) bool {\n    return hasStraight(password) and !hasInvalidChars(password) and hasTwoPairs(password);\n}\n\nfn hasStraight(password: []const u8) bool {\n    for (password[0 ..
