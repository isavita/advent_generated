There are some radiation warnings and a big sign which reads \"Radioisotope Testing Facility\".\n\nAccording to the project status board, this facility is currently being used to experiment with Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs, or simply \"generators\") that are designed to be paired with specially-constructed microchips. Basically, an RTG is a highly radioactive rock that generates electricity through heat.\n\nThe experimental RTGs have poor radiation containment, so they're dangerously radioactive. The chips are prototypes and don't have normal radiation shielding, but they do have the ability to generate an electromagnetic radiation shield when powered. Unfortunately, they can only be powered by their corresponding RTG. An RTG powering a microchip is still dangerous to other microchips.\n\nIn other words, if a chip is ever left in the same area as another RTG, and it's not connected to its own RTG, the chip will be fried. Therefore, it is assumed that you will follow procedure and keep chips connected to their corresponding RTG when they're in the same room, and away from other RTGs otherwise.\n\nThese microchips sound very interesting and useful to your current activities, and you'd like to try to retrieve them. The fourth floor of the facility has an assembling machine which can make a self-contained, shielded computer for you to take with you - that is, if you can bring it all of the RTGs and microchips.\n\nWithin the radiation-shielded part of the facility (in which it's safe to have these pre-assembly RTGs), there is an elevator that can move between the four floors. Its capacity rating means it can carry at most yourself and two RTGs or microchips in any combination. (They're rigged to some heavy diagnostic equipment - the assembling machine will detach it for you.) As a security measure, the elevator will only function if it contains at least one RTG or microchip. The elevator always stops on each floor to recharge, and this takes long enough that the items within it and the items on that floor can irradiate each other. (You can prevent this if a Microchip and its Generator end up on the same floor in this way, as they can be connected while the elevator is recharging.)\n\nYou make some notes of the locations of each component of interest (your puzzle input). Before you don a hazmat suit and start moving things around, you'd like to have an idea of what you need to do.\n\nWhen you enter the containment area, you and the elevator will start on the first floor.\n\nFor example, suppose the isolated area has the following arrangement:\n\nThe first floor contains a hydrogen-compatible microchip and a lithium-compatible microchip.\nThe second floor contains a hydrogen generator.\nThe third floor contains a lithium generator.\nThe fourth floor contains nothing relevant.\nAs a diagram (F# for a Floor number, E for Elevator, H for Hydrogen, L for Lithium, M for Microchip, and G for Generator), the initial state looks like this:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 .  .  .  LG .  \nF2 .  HG .  .  .  \nF1 E  .  HM .  LM \nThen, to get everything up to the assembling machine on the fourth floor, the following steps could be taken:\n\nBring the Hydrogen-compatible Microchip to the second floor, which is safe because it can get power from the Hydrogen Generator:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 .  .  .  LG .  \nF2 E  HG HM .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  LM \nBring both Hydrogen-related items to the third floor, which is safe because the Hydrogen-compatible microchip is getting power from its generator:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 E  HG HM LG .  \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  LM \nLeave the Hydrogen Generator on floor three, but bring the Hydrogen-compatible Microchip back down with you so you can still use the elevator:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 .  HG .  LG .  \nF2 E  .  HM .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  LM \nAt the first floor, grab the Lithium-compatible Microchip, which is safe because Microchips don't affect each other:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 .  HG .  LG .  \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 E  .  HM .  LM \nBring both Microchips up one floor, where there is nothing to fry them:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 .  HG .  LG .  \nF2 E  .  HM .  LM \nF1 .  .  .  .  .  \nBring both Microchips up again to floor three, where they can be temporarily connected to their corresponding generators while the elevator recharges, preventing either of them from being fried:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  .  \nF3 E  HG HM LG LM \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  .  \nBring both Microchips to the fourth floor:\n\nF4 E  .  HM .  LM \nF3 .  HG .  LG .  \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  .  \nLeave the Lithium-compatible microchip on the fourth floor, but bring the Hydrogen-compatible one so you can still use the elevator; this is safe because although the Lithium Generator is on the destination floor, you can connect Hydrogen-compatible microchip to the Hydrogen Generator there:\n\nF4 .  .  .  .  LM \nF3 E  HG HM LG .  \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  .  \nBring both Generators up to the fourth floor, which is safe because you can connect the Lithium-compatible Microchip to the Lithium Generator upon arrival:\n\nF4 E  HG .  LG LM \nF3 .  .  HM .  .  \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  .  \nBring the Lithium Microchip with you to the third floor so you can use the elevator:\n\nF4 .  HG .  LG .  \nF3 E  .  HM .  LM \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  .  \nBring both Microchips to the fourth floor:\n\nF4 E  HG HM LG LM \nF3 .  .  .  .  .  \nF2 .  .  .  .  .  \nF1 .  .  .  .  .  \nIn this arrangement, it takes 11 steps to collect all of the objects at the fourth floor for assembly. (Each elevator stop counts as one step, even if nothing is added to or removed from it.)\n\nIn your situation, what is the minimum number of steps required to bring all of the objects to the fourth floor?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\ncall() ->\n    Answer = 31,\n    io:format(\"~p~n\", [Answer]).\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

With that much time, you should be able to collect all fifty stars by December 25th.\n\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day millisecond in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n\nYou're standing in a room with \"digitization quarantine\" written in LEDs along one wall.

The following steps would be taken before an exit is found:\n\n(0) 3  0  1  -3  - before we have taken any steps.\n(1) 3  0  1  -3  - jump with offset 0 (that is, don't jump at all). Fortunately, the instruction is then incremented to 1.\n2 (3) 0  1  -3  - step forward because of the instruction we just modified. The first instruction is incremented again, now to 2.\n2  4  0  1 (-3) - jump all the way to the end; leave a 4 behind.\n2 (4) 0  1  -2  - go back to where we just were; increment -3 to -2.\n2  5  0  1  -2  - jump 4 steps forward, escaping the maze.\nIn this example, the exit is reached in 5 steps.\n\nHow many steps does it take to reach the exit?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\nparse_input() ->\n    {ok, File} = file:read_file(\"input.txt\"),\n    [list_to_integer(X) || X <- string:split(binary_to_list(File), \"\\n\",all)].\n\njump(Instructions, Index, Steps) when Index < 1 orelse Index > length(Instructions) ->\n    Steps;\njump(Instructions, Index, Steps) ->\n    NextIndex = Index + lists:nth(Index, Instructions),\n    NewInstructions = lists:sublist(Instructions, Index-1) ++ [lists:nth(Index, Instructions) + 1] ++ lists:nthtail(Index, Instructions),\n    jump(NewInstructions, NextIndex, Steps + 1).\n\ncall() ->\n    Instructions = parse_input(),\n    io:format(\"~p~n\", [jump(Instructions, 1, 0)]).\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

The generators, called generator A and generator B, are trying to agree on a sequence of numbers. However, one of them is malfunctioning, and so the sequences don't always match.\n\nAs they do this, a judge waits for each of them to generate its next value, compares the lowest 16 bits of both values, and keeps track of the number of times those parts of the values match.\n\nThe generators both work on the same principle. To create its next value, a generator will take the previous value it produced, multiply it by a factor (generator A uses 16807; generator B uses 48271), and then keep the remainder of dividing that resulting product by 2147483647. That final remainder is the value it produces next.\n\nTo calculate each generator's first value, it instead uses a specific starting value as its \"previous value\" (as listed in your puzzle input).\n\nFor example, suppose that for starting values, generator A uses 65, while generator B uses 8921. Then, the first five pairs of generated values are:\n\n--Gen. A--  --Gen.

Because of this one match, after processing these five pairs, the judge would have added only 1 to its total.\n\nTo get a significant sample, the judge would like to consider 40 million pairs.

As you get close, you find an experimental coprocessor doing so much work that the local programs are afraid it will halt and catch fire. This would cause serious issues for the rest of the computer, so you head in and see what you can do.\n\nThe code it's running seems to be a variant of the kind you saw recently on that tablet. The general functionality seems very similar, but some of the instructions are different:\n\nset X Y sets register X to the value of Y.\nsub X Y decreases register X by the value of Y.\nmul X Y sets register X to the result of multiplying the value contained in register X by the value of Y.\njnz X Y jumps with an offset of the value of Y, but only if the value of X is not zero. (An offset of 2 skips the next instruction, an offset of -1 jumps to the previous instruction, and so on.)\nOnly the instructions listed above are used. The eight registers here, named a through h, all start at 0.\n\nThe coprocessor is currently set to some kind of debug mode, which allows for testing, but prevents it from doing any meaningful work.\n\nIf you run the program (your puzzle input), how many times is the mul instruction invoked?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 3025.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow, it's time to fix the problem.\n\nThe debug mode switch is wired directly to register a. You flip the switch, which makes register a now start at 1 when the program is executed.\n\nImmediately, the coprocessor begins to overheat. Whoever wrote this program obviously didn't choose a very efficient implementation. You'll need to optimize the program if it has any hope of completing before Santa needs that printer working.\n\nThe coprocessor's ultimate goal is to determine the final value left in register h once the program completes. Technically, if it had that... it wouldn't even need to run the program.\n\nAfter setting register a to 1, if the program were to run to completion, what value would be left in register h?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\nis_prime(N) -> \n    is_prime(N, 2).\nis_prime(N, I) when I*I =< N -> \n    case N rem I of\n        0 -> false;\n        _ -> is_prime(N, I+1)\n    end;\nis_prime(_N, _I) -> \n    true.\n\ncall() ->\n    B = 57*100 + 100000,\n    C = B + 17000,\n    H = count_primes(B, C, 0),\n    io:format(\"~p~n\", [H]).\n\ncount_primes(B, C, H) when B =< C -> \n    NewH = case is_prime(B) of\n                true -> H;\n                false -> H + 1\n           end,\n    count_primes(B+17, C, NewH);\ncount_primes(_B, _C, H) -> \n    H.\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

Unfortunately, anomalies are still affecting them - nobody can even agree on how to cut the fabric.\n\nThe whole piece of fabric they're working on is a very large square - at least 1000 inches on each side.\n\nEach Elf has made a claim about which area of fabric would be ideal for Santa's suit. All claims have an ID and consist of a single rectangle with edges parallel to the edges of the fabric. Each claim's rectangle is defined as follows:\n\nThe number of inches between the left edge of the fabric and the left edge of the rectangle.\nThe number of inches between the top edge of the fabric and the top edge of the rectangle.\nThe width of the rectangle in inches.\nThe height of the rectangle in inches.\nA claim like #123 @ 3,2: 5x4 means that claim ID 123 specifies a rectangle 3 inches from the left edge, 2 inches from the top edge, 5 inches wide, and 4 inches tall. Visually, it claims the square inches of fabric represented by # (and ignores the square inches of fabric represented by .) in the diagram below:\n\n...........\n...........\n...#####...\n...#####...\n...#####...\n...#####...\n...........\n...........\n...........\nThe problem is that many of the claims overlap, causing two or more claims to cover part of the same areas.

All claims have an ID and consist of a single rectangle with edges parallel to the edges of the fabric. Each claim's rectangle is defined as follows:\n\nThe number of inches between the left edge of the fabric and the left edge of the rectangle.\nThe number of inches between the top edge of the fabric and the top edge of the rectangle.\nThe width of the rectangle in inches.\nThe height of the rectangle in inches.\nA claim like #123 @ 3,2: 5x4 means that claim ID 123 specifies a rectangle 3 inches from the left edge, 2 inches from the top edge, 5 inches wide, and 4 inches tall.

Apparently, you forgot to include additional fuel for the fuel you just added.\n\nFuel itself requires fuel just like a module - take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2. However, that fuel also requires fuel, and that fuel requires fuel, and so on. Any mass that would require negative fuel should instead be treated as if it requires zero fuel; the remaining mass, if any, is instead handled by wishing really hard, which has no mass and is outside the scope of this calculation.\n\nSo, for each module mass, calculate its fuel and add it to the total. Then, treat the fuel amount you just calculated as the input mass and repeat the process, continuing until a fuel requirement is zero or negative. For example:\n\nA module of mass 14 requires 2 fuel. This fuel requires no further fuel (2 divided by 3 and rounded down is 0, which would call for a negative fuel), so the total fuel required is still just 2.\nAt first, a module of mass 1969 requires 654 fuel. Then, this fuel requires 216 more fuel (654 / 3 - 2). 216 then requires 70 more fuel, which requires 21 fuel, which requires 5 fuel, which requires no further fuel. So, the total fuel required for a module of mass 1969 is 654 + 216 + 70 + 21 + 5 = 966.\nThe fuel required by a module of mass 100756 and its fuel is: 33583 + 11192 + 3728 + 1240 + 411 + 135 + 43 + 12 + 2 = 50346.\nWhat is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft when also taking into account the mass of the added fuel?

On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: \"Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--\" The ship computer bursts into flames.\n\nYou notify the Elves that the computer's magic smoke seems to have escaped. \"That computer ran Intcode programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!\"\n\nAn Intcode program is a list of integers separated by commas (like 1,0,0,3,99). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position 0). Here, you will find an opcode - either 1, 2, or 99. The opcode indicates what to do; for example, 99 means that the program is finished and should immediately halt. Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.\n\nOpcode 1 adds together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.\n\nFor example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.\n\nOpcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.\n\nOnce you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following program:\n\n1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50\nFor the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:\n\n1,9,10,3,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nThe first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the output (3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:\n\n1,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStep forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively.

On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: \"Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--\" The ship computer bursts into flames.\n\nYou notify the Elves that the computer's magic smoke seems to have escaped. \"That computer ran Intcode programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!\"\n\nAn Intcode program is a list of integers separated by commas (like 1,0,0,3,99). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position 0). Here, you will find an opcode - either 1, 2, or 99. The opcode indicates what to do; for example, 99 means that the program is finished and should immediately halt. Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.\n\nOpcode 1 adds together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.\n\nFor example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.\n\nOpcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.\n\nOnce you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following program:\n\n1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50\nFor the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:\n\n1,9,10,3,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nThe first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the output (3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:\n\n1,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStep forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively. Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:\n\n3500,9,10,70,\n2,3,11,0,\n99,\n30,40,50\nStepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode 99, halting the program.\n\nHere are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:\n\n1,0,0,0,99 becomes 2,0,0,0,99 (1 + 1 = 2).\n2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,6,99 (3 * 2 = 6).\n2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,9801 (99 * 99 = 9801).\n1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99 becomes 30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99.\nOnce you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity assist program (your puzzle input) to the \"1202 program alarm\" state it had just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the value 2. What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 4714701.\n\n--- Part Two ---\n\"Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly! Keep it nearby during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what they are as you need them.\"\n\n\"However, your current priority should be to complete your gravity assist around the Moon. For this mission to succeed, we should settle on some terminology for the parts you've already built.\"\n\nIntcode programs are given as a list of integers; these values are used as the initial state for the computer's memory. When you run an Intcode program, make sure to start by initializing memory to the program's values. A position in memory is called an address (for example, the first value in memory is at \"address 0\").\n\nOpcodes (like 1, 2, or 99) mark the beginning of an instruction. The values used immediately after an opcode, if any, are called the instruction's parameters. For example, in the instruction 1,2,3,4, 1 is the opcode; 2, 3, and 4 are the parameters. The instruction 99 contains only an opcode and has no parameters.\n\nThe address of the current instruction is called the instruction pointer; it starts at 0. After an instruction finishes, the instruction pointer increases by the number of values in the instruction; until you add more instructions to the computer, this is always 4 (1 opcode + 3 parameters) for the add and multiply instructions. (The halt instruction would increase the instruction pointer by 1, but it halts the program instead.)\n\n\"With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the gravity assist, you need to determine what pair of inputs produces the output 19690720.\"\n\nThe inputs should still be provided to the program by replacing the values at addresses 1 and 2, just like before. In this program, the value placed in address 1 is called the noun, and the value placed in address 2 is called the verb. Each of the two input values will be between 0 and 99, inclusive.\n\nOnce the program has halted, its output is available at address 0, also just like before. Each time you try a pair of inputs, make sure you first reset the computer's memory to the values in the program (your puzzle input) - in other words, don't reuse memory from a previous attempt.\n\nFind the input noun and verb that cause the program to produce the output 19690720. What is 100 * noun + verb? (For example, if noun=12 and verb=2, the answer would be 1202.)\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\ncall() ->\n    {ok, Input} = file:read_file(\"input.txt\"),\n    Program = parse_input(binary_to_list(Input)),\n    Answer = find_inputs(Program),\n    io:format(\"~p~n\", [Answer]).\n\nparse_input(Input) ->\n    [list_to_integer(X) || X <- string:tokens(Input, \",\\n\")].\n\nfind_inputs(Program) ->\n    find_inputs(Program, 0, 99).\n\nfind_inputs(Program, Noun, Verb) when Noun =< 99 ->\n    RestoredProgram = lists:sublist(Program, 1) ++ [Noun, Verb] ++ lists:nthtail(3, Program),\n    case run_program(RestoredProgram) of\n        19690720 ->\n            100 * Noun + Verb;\n        _ ->\n            if\n                Verb < 99 ->\n                    find_inputs(Program, Noun, Verb + 1);\n                true ->\n                    find_inputs(Program, Noun + 1, 0)\n            end\n    end.\n\nrun_program(Program) ->\n    run_program(Program, 0).\n\nrun_program(Program, Position) ->\n    case lists:nth(Position + 1, Program) of\n        99 ->\n            lists:nth(1, Program);\n        1 ->\n            Pos1 = lists:nth(Position + 2, Program),\n            Pos2 = lists:nth(Position + 3, Program),\n            Pos3 = lists:nth(Position + 4, Program),\n            Value1 = lists:nth(Pos1 + 1, Program),\n            Value2 = lists:nth(Pos2 + 1, Program),\n            Result = Value1 + Value2,\n            UpdatedProgram = lists:sublist(Program, Pos3) ++ [Result] ++ lists:nthtail(Pos3 + 1, Program),\n            run_program(UpdatedProgram, Position + 4);\n        2 ->\n            Pos1 = lists:nth(Position + 2, Program),\n            Pos2 = lists:nth(Position + 3, Program),\n            Pos3 = lists:nth(Position + 4, Program),\n            Value1 = lists:nth(Pos1 + 1, Program),\n            Value2 = lists:nth(Pos2 + 1, Program),\n            Result = Value1 * Value2,\n            UpdatedProgram = lists:sublist(Program, Pos3) ++ [Result] ++ lists:nthtail(Pos3 + 1, Program),\n            run_program(UpdatedProgram, Position + 4)\n    end.\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

Because navigation in space often involves transferring between orbits, the orbit maps here are useful for finding efficient routes between, for example, you and Santa. You download a map of the local orbits (your puzzle input).\n\nExcept for the universal Center of Mass (COM), every object in space is in orbit around exactly one other object. An orbit looks roughly like this:\n\n                                                         |\n                    |\nAAA--> o            o <--BBB\n                    |\n                    |\n                   /\n                  /\nIn this diagram, the object BBB is in orbit around AAA. The path that BBB takes around AAA (drawn with lines) is only partly shown. In the map data, this orbital relationship is written AAA)BBB, which means \"BBB is in orbit around AAA\".\n\nBefore you use your map data to plot a course, you need to make sure it wasn't corrupted during the download. To verify maps, the Universal Orbit Map facility uses orbit count checksums - the total number of direct orbits (like the one shown above) and indirect orbits.\n\nWhenever A orbits B and B orbits C, then A indirectly orbits C. This chain can be any number of objects long: if A orbits B, B orbits C, and C orbits D, then A indirectly orbits D.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following map:\n\nCOM)B\nB)C\nC)D\nD)E\nE)F\nB)G\nG)H\nD)I\nE)J\nJ)K\nK)L\nVisually, the above map of orbits looks like this:\n\n        G - H       J - K - L\n       /           /\nCOM - B - C - D - E - F\n                               I\nIn this visual representation, when two objects are connected by a line, the one on the right directly orbits the one on the left.\n\nHere, we can count the total number of orbits as follows:\n\nD directly orbits C and indirectly orbits B and COM, a total of 3 orbits.\nL directly orbits K and indirectly orbits J, E, D, C, B, and COM, a total of 7 orbits.\nCOM orbits nothing.\nThe total number of direct and indirect orbits in this example is 42.\n\nWhat is the total number of direct and indirect orbits in your map data?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\ncall() ->\n    {ok, Data} = file:read_file(\"input.txt\"),\n    Lines = string:tokens(binary_to_list(Data), \"\\n\"),\n    OrbitMap = lists:foldl(fun(Line, Map) ->\n                                [Center, Orbiter] = string:tokens(Line, \")\"),\n                                case maps:is_key(Center, Map) of\n                                    true -> NewMap = maps:update(Center, [Orbiter | maps:get(Center, Map)], Map);\n                                    false -> NewMap = maps:put(Center, [Orbiter], Map)\n                                end,\n                                NewMap\n                            end, #{}, Lines),\n    TotalOrbits = count_orbits(OrbitMap, \"COM\", 0),\n    io:format(\"~p~n\", [TotalOrbits]).\n\ncount_orbits(OrbitMap, Start, Depth) ->\n    Orbits = maps:get(Start, OrbitMap, []),\n    case length(Orbits) of\n        0 -> Depth;\n        _ -> Depth + lists:sum([count_orbits(OrbitMap, Orbit, Depth + 1) || Orbit <- Orbits])\n    end.\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

The expected fields are as follows:\n\nbyr (Birth Year)\niyr (Issue Year)\neyr (Expiration Year)\nhgt (Height)\nhcl (Hair Color)\necl (Eye Color)\npid (Passport ID)\ncid (Country ID)\nPassport data is validated in batch files (your puzzle input). Each passport is represented as a sequence of key:value pairs separated by spaces or newlines. Passports are separated by blank lines.\n\nHere is an example batch file containing four passports:\n\necl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd\nbyr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm\n\niyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884\nhcl:#cfa07d byr:1929\n\nhcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013\neyr:2024\necl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931\nhgt:179cm\n\nhcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648\niyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in\nThe first passport is valid - all eight fields are present. The second passport is invalid - it is missing hgt (the Height field).\n\nThe third passport is interesting; the only missing field is cid, so it looks like data from North Pole Credentials, not a passport at all! Surely, nobody would mind if you made the system temporarily ignore missing cid fields. Treat this \"passport\" as valid.\n\nThe fourth passport is missing two fields, cid and byr. Missing cid is fine, but missing any other field is not, so this passport is invalid.\n\nAccording to the above rules, your improved system would report 2 valid passports.\n\nCount the number of valid passports - those that have all required fields.

You aren't sure which seat is yours, and all of the flight attendants are busy with the flood of people that suddenly made it through passport control.\n\nYou write a quick program to use your phone's camera to scan all of the nearby boarding passes (your puzzle input); perhaps you can find your seat through process of elimination.\n\nInstead of zones or groups, this airline uses binary space partitioning to seat people. A seat might be specified like FBFBBFFRLR, where F means \"front\", B means \"back\", L means \"left\", and R means \"right\".\n\nThe first 7 characters will either be F or B; these specify exactly one of the 128 rows on the plane (numbered 0 through 127). Each letter tells you which half of a region the given seat is in. Start with the whole list of rows; the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the front (0 through 63) or the back (64 through 127). The next letter indicates which half of that region the seat is in, and so on until you're left with exactly one row.\n\nFor example, consider just the first seven characters of FBFBBFFRLR:\n\nStart by considering the whole range, rows 0 through 127.\nF means to take the lower half, keeping rows 0 through 63.\nB means to take the upper half, keeping rows 32 through 63.\nF means to take the lower half, keeping rows 32 through 47.\nB means to take the upper half, keeping rows 40 through 47.\nB keeps rows 44 through 47.\nF keeps rows 44 through 45.\nThe final F keeps the lower of the two, row 44.\nThe last three characters will be either L or R; these specify exactly one of the 8 columns of seats on the plane (numbered 0 through 7). The same process as above proceeds again, this time with only three steps. L means to keep the lower half, while R means to keep the upper half.\n\nFor example, consider just the last 3 characters of FBFBBFFRLR:\n\nStart by considering the whole range, columns 0 through 7.\nR means to take the upper half, keeping columns 4 through 7.\nL means to take the lower half, keeping columns 4 through 5.\nThe final R keeps the upper of the two, column 5.\nSo, decoding FBFBBFFRLR reveals that it is the seat at row 44, column 5.\n\nEvery seat also has a unique seat ID: multiply the row by 8, then add the column. In this example, the seat has ID 44 * 8 + 5 = 357.\n\nHere are some other boarding passes:\n\nBFFFBBFRRR: row 70, column 7, seat ID 567.\nFFFBBBFRRR: row 14, column 7, seat ID 119.\nBBFFBBFRLL: row 102, column 4, seat ID 820.\nAs a sanity check, look through your list of boarding passes.

When you call to book another ship, you discover that no ships embark from that port to your vacation island. You'll need to get from the port to the nearest airport.\n\nFortunately, a shuttle bus service is available to bring you from the sea port to the airport! Each bus has an ID number that also indicates how often the bus leaves for the airport.\n\nBus schedules are defined based on a timestamp that measures the number of minutes since some fixed reference point in the past. At timestamp 0, every bus simultaneously departed from the sea port. After that, each bus travels to the airport, then various other locations, and finally returns to the sea port to repeat its journey forever.\n\nThe time this loop takes a particular bus is also its ID number: the bus with ID 5 departs from the sea port at timestamps 0, 5, 10, 15, and so on. The bus with ID 11 departs at 0, 11, 22, 33, and so on. If you are there when the bus departs, you can ride that bus to the airport!\n\nYour notes (your puzzle input) consist of two lines. The first line is your estimate of the earliest timestamp you could depart on a bus. The second line lists the bus IDs that are in service according to the shuttle company; entries that show x must be out of service, so you decide to ignore them.\n\nTo save time once you arrive, your goal is to figure out the earliest bus you can take to the airport. (There will be exactly one such bus.)\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following notes:\n\n939\n7,13,x,x,59,x,31,19\nHere, the earliest timestamp you could depart is 939, and the bus IDs in service are 7, 13, 59, 31, and 19.

Due to the storm, all direct flights have been cancelled, but a route is available to get around the storm. You take it.\n\nWhile you wait for your flight, you decide to check in with the Elves back at the North Pole. They're playing a memory game and are ever so excited to explain the rules!\n\nIn this game, the players take turns saying numbers. They begin by taking turns reading from a list of starting numbers (your puzzle input). Then, each turn consists of considering the most recently spoken number:\n\nIf that was the first time the number has been spoken, the current player says 0.\nOtherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces how many turns apart the number is from when it was previously spoken.\nSo, after the starting numbers, each turn results in that player speaking aloud either 0 (if the last number is new) or an age (if the last number is a repeat).\n\nFor example, suppose the starting numbers are 0,3,6:\n\nTurn 1: The 1st number spoken is a starting number, 0.\nTurn 2: The 2nd number spoken is a starting number, 3.\nTurn 3: The 3rd number spoken is a starting number, 6.\nTurn 4: Now, consider the last number spoken, 6. Since that was the first time the number had been spoken, the 4th number spoken is 0.\nTurn 5: Next, again consider the last number spoken, 0. Since it had been spoken before, the next number to speak is the difference between the turn number when it was last spoken (the previous turn, 4) and the turn number of the time it was most recently spoken before then (turn 1). Thus, the 5th number spoken is 4 - 1, 3.\nTurn 6: The last number spoken, 3 had also been spoken before, most recently on turns 5 and 2. So, the 6th number spoken is 5 - 2, 3.\nTurn 7: Since 3 was just spoken twice in a row, and the last two turns are 1 turn apart, the 7th number spoken is 1.\nTurn 8: Since 1 is new, the 8th number spoken is 0.\nTurn 9: 0 was last spoken on turns 8 and 4, so the 9th number spoken is the difference between them, 4.\nTurn 10: 4 is new, so the 10th number spoken is 0.\n(The game ends when the Elves get sick of playing or dinner is ready, whichever comes first.)\n\nTheir question for you is: what will be the 2020th number spoken? In the example above, the 2020th number spoken will be 436.\n\nHere are a few more examples:\n\nGiven the starting numbers 1,3,2, the 2020th number spoken is 1.\nGiven the starting numbers 2,1,3, the 2020th number spoken is 10.\nGiven the starting numbers 1,2,3, the 2020th number spoken is 27.\nGiven the starting numbers 2,3,1, the 2020th number spoken is 78.\nGiven the starting numbers 3,2,1, the 2020th number spoken is 438.\nGiven the starting numbers 3,1,2, the 2020th number spoken is 1836.\nGiven your starting numbers, what will be the 2020th number spoken?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\ncall() ->\n    {ok, Input} = file:read_file(\"input.txt\"),\n    StartingNumbers = string:tokens(binary:bin_to_list(Input), \",\\n\"),\n    LastSpoken = dict:new(),\n    {_, Answer} = lists:foldl(fun(Turn, {PrevNumber, LastSpokenDict}) ->\n        case Turn of\n            1 -> {list_to_integer(hd(StartingNumbers)), LastSpokenDict};\n            _ when Turn =< 2020 ->\n                LastNumber = PrevNumber,\n                NextNumber = case dict:find(LastNumber, LastSpokenDict) of\n                    {ok, LastTurn} when LastTurn /= Turn-1 -> Turn-1 - LastTurn;\n                    _ -> 0\n                end,\n                NewLastSpokenDict = dict:store(LastNumber, Turn-1, LastSpokenDict),\n                {NextNumber, NewLastSpokenDict}\n        end\n    end, {0, LastSpoken}, lists:seq(1, 2020)),\n    io:format(\"~p~n\", [Answer]).\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

Unfortunately, their registration systems are currently offline, and they cannot check you in. Noticing the look on your face, they quickly add that tech support is already on the way! They even created all the room keys this morning; you can take yours now and give them your room deposit once the registration system comes back online.\n\nThe room key is a small RFID card. Your room is on the 25th floor and the elevators are also temporarily out of service, so it takes what little energy you have left to even climb the stairs and navigate the halls. You finally reach the door to your room, swipe your card, and - beep - the light turns red.\n\nExamining the card more closely, you discover a phone number for tech support.\n\n\"Hello! How can we help you today?\" You explain the situation.\n\n\"Well, it sounds like the card isn't sending the right command to unlock the door. If you go back to the check-in desk, surely someone there can reset it for you.\" Still catching your breath, you describe the status of the elevator and the exact number of stairs you just had to climb.\n\n\"I see! Well, your only other option would be to reverse-engineer the cryptographic handshake the card does with the door and then inject your own commands into the data stream, but that's definitely impossible.\" You thank them for their time.\n\nUnfortunately for the door, you know a thing or two about cryptographic handshakes.\n\nThe handshake used by the card and the door involves an operation that transforms a subject number. To transform a subject number, start with the value 1. Then, a number of times called the loop size, perform the following steps:\n\nSet the value to itself multiplied by the subject number.\nSet the value to the remainder after dividing the value by 20201227.\nThe card always uses a specific, secret loop size when it transforms a subject number. The door always uses a different, secret loop size.\n\nThe cryptographic handshake works like this:\n\nThe card transforms the subject number of 7 according to the card's secret loop size. The result is called the card's public key.\nThe door transforms the subject number of 7 according to the door's secret loop size. The result is called the door's public key.\nThe card and door use the wireless RFID signal to transmit the two public keys (your puzzle input) to the other device. Now, the card has the door's public key, and the door has the card's public key. Because you can eavesdrop on the signal, you have both public keys, but neither device's loop size.\nThe card transforms the subject number of the door's public key according to the card's loop size. The result is the encryption key.\nThe door transforms the subject number of the card's public key according to the door's loop size. The result is the same encryption key as the card calculated.\nIf you can use the two public keys to determine each device's loop size, you will have enough information to calculate the secret encryption key that the card and door use to communicate; this would let you send the unlock command directly to the door!\n\nFor example, suppose you know that the card's public key is 5764801. With a little trial and error, you can work out that the card's loop size must be 8, because transforming the initial subject number of 7 with a loop size of 8 produces 5764801.\n\nThen, suppose you know that the door's public key is 17807724. By the same process, you can determine that the door's loop size is 11, because transforming the initial subject number of 7 with a loop size of 11 produces 17807724.\n\nAt this point, you can use either device's loop size with the other device's public key to calculate the encryption key. Transforming the subject number of 17807724 (the door's public key) with a loop size of 8 (the card's loop size) produces the encryption key, 14897079. (Transforming the subject number of 5764801 (the card's public key) with a loop size of 11 (the door's loop size) produces the same encryption key: 14897079.)\n\nWhat encryption key is the handshake trying to establish?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\ncall() ->\n    {ok, File} = file:read_file(\"input.txt\"),\n    [CardPublicKeyStr, DoorPublicKeyStr] = string:tokens(binary_to_list(File), \"\\n\"),\n    CardPublicKey = list_to_integer(CardPublicKeyStr),\n    DoorPublicKey = list_to_integer(DoorPublicKeyStr),\n    CardLoopSize = find_loop_size(CardPublicKey, 1, 0),\n    EncryptionKey = transform(DoorPublicKey, CardLoopSize),\n    io:format(\"~p~n\", [EncryptionKey]).\n\nfind_loop_size(PublicKey, Value, LoopSize) when Value =:= PublicKey ->\n    LoopSize;\nfind_loop_size(PublicKey, Value, LoopSize) ->\n    NewValue = (Value * 7) rem 20201227,\n    find_loop_size(PublicKey, NewValue, LoopSize + 1).\n\ntransform(SubjectNumber, LoopSize) ->\n    lists:foldl(fun(_, Acc) -> (Acc * SubjectNumber) rem 20201227 end, 1, lists:seq(1, LoopSize)).\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

Again considering the above example:\n\n199  A      \n200  A B    \n208  A B C  \n210    B C D\n200  E   C D\n207  E F   D\n240  E F G  \n269    F G H\n260      G H\n263        H\nStart by comparing the first and second three-measurement windows. The measurements in the first window are marked A (199, 200, 208); their sum is 199 + 200 + 208 = 607. The second window is marked B (200, 208, 210); its sum is 618. The sum of measurements in the second window is larger than the sum of the first, so this first comparison increased.\n\nYour goal now is to count the number of times the sum of measurements in this sliding window increases from the previous sum. So, compare A with B, then compare B with C, then C with D, and so on. Stop when there aren't enough measurements left to create a new three-measurement sum.\n\nIn the above example, the sum of each three-measurement window is as follows:\n\nA: 607 (N/A - no previous sum)\nB: 618 (increased)\nC: 618 (no change)\nD: 617 (decreased)\nE: 647 (increased)\nF: 716 (increased)\nG: 769 (increased)\nH: 792 (increased)\nIn this example, there are 5 sums that are larger than the previous sum.\n\nConsider sums of a three-measurement sliding window. How many sums are larger than the previous sum?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\nread_file(FileName) ->\n    {ok, Binary} = file:read_file(FileName),\n    Lines = binary:split(Binary, <<\"\\n\">>, [global, trim]),\n    lists:map(fun(X) -> list_to_integer(binary:bin_to_list(X)) end, Lines).\n\ncount_increases([_]) -> 0;\ncount_increases([H1,H2|T]) when H2 > H1 -> 1 + count_increases([H2|T]);\ncount_increases([H1,H2|T]) -> count_increases([H2|T]).\n\nsliding_window_sums([_,_,_]=L, Acc) -> {Acc, L};\nsliding_window_sums([H1,H2,H3|T], {Count, PrevSum}) ->\n    Sum = H1 + H2 + H3,\n    case Sum of\n        _ when Count == 0 -> sliding_window_sums([H2,H3|T], {1, Sum});\n        _ when Sum > PrevSum -> sliding_window_sums([H2,H3|T], {Count+1, Sum});\n        _ -> sliding_window_sums([H2,H3|T], {Count, Sum})\n    end.\n\ncall() ->\n    Depths = read_file(\"input.txt\"),\n    Answer1 = count_increases(Depths),\n    {Answer2, _} = sliding_window_sums(Depths, {0, 0}),\n    io:format(\"~p~n~p~n\", [Answer1, Answer2]).\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

Both values are located using a similar process that involves filtering out values until only one remains. Before searching for either rating value, start with the full list of binary numbers from your diagnostic report and consider just the first bit of those numbers. Then:\n\nKeep only numbers selected by the bit criteria for the type of rating value for which you are searching. Discard numbers which do not match the bit criteria.\nIf you only have one number left, stop; this is the rating value for which you are searching.\nOtherwise, repeat the process, considering the next bit to the right.\nThe bit criteria depends on which type of rating value you want to find:\n\nTo find oxygen generator rating, determine the most common value (0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 1 in the position being considered.\nTo find CO2 scrubber rating, determine the least common value (0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 0 in the position being considered.\nFor example, to determine the oxygen generator rating value using the same example diagnostic report from above:\n\nStart with all 12 numbers and consider only the first bit of each number. There are more 1 bits (7) than 0 bits (5), so keep only the 7 numbers with a 1 in the first position: 11110, 10110, 10111, 10101, 11100, 10000, and 11001.\nThen, consider the second bit of the 7 remaining numbers: there are more 0 bits (4) than 1 bits (3), so keep only the 4 numbers with a 0 in the second position: 10110, 10111, 10101, and 10000.\nIn the third position, three of the four numbers have a 1, so keep those three: 10110, 10111, and 10101.\nIn the fourth position, two of the three numbers have a 1, so keep those two: 10110 and 10111.\nIn the fifth position, there are an equal number of 0 bits and 1 bits (one each). So, to find the oxygen generator rating, keep the number with a 1 in that position: 10111.\nAs there is only one number left, stop; the oxygen generator rating is 10111, or 23 in decimal.\nThen, to determine the CO2 scrubber rating value from the same example above:\n\nStart again with all 12 numbers and consider only the first bit of each number. There are fewer 0 bits (5) than 1 bits (7), so keep only the 5 numbers with a 0 in the first position: 00100, 01111, 00111, 00010, and 01010.\nThen, consider the second bit of the 5 remaining numbers: there are fewer 1 bits (2) than 0 bits (3), so keep only the 2 numbers with a 1 in the second position: 01111 and 01010.\nIn the third position, there are an equal number of 0 bits and 1 bits (one each). So, to find the CO2 scrubber rating, keep the number with a 0 in that position: 01010.\nAs there is only one number left, stop; the CO2 scrubber rating is 01010, or 10 in decimal.\nFinally, to find the life support rating, multiply the oxygen generator rating (23) by the CO2 scrubber rating (10) to get 230.\n\nUse the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the oxygen generator rating and CO2 scrubber rating, then multiply them together.

There's nowhere to run!\n\nSuddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it's too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a massive underground cave system just beyond where they're aiming!\n\nThe crab submarines all need to be aligned before they'll have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get through. However, it doesn't look like they'll be aligned before the whale catches you! Maybe you can help?\n\nThere's one major catch - crab submarines can only move horizontally.\n\nYou quickly make a list of the horizontal position of each crab (your puzzle input). Crab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible.\n\nFor example, consider the following horizontal positions:\n\n16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14\nThis means there's a crab with horizontal position 16, a crab with horizontal position 1, and so on.\n\nEach change of 1 step in horizontal position of a single crab costs 1 fuel. You could choose any horizontal position to align them all on, but the one that costs the least fuel is horizontal position 2:\n\nMove from 16 to 2: 14 fuel\nMove from 1 to 2: 1 fuel\nMove from 2 to 2: 0 fuel\nMove from 0 to 2: 2 fuel\nMove from 4 to 2: 2 fuel\nMove from 2 to 2: 0 fuel\nMove from 7 to 2: 5 fuel\nMove from 1 to 2: 1 fuel\nMove from 2 to 2: 0 fuel\nMove from 14 to 2: 12 fuel\nThis costs a total of 37 fuel. This is the cheapest possible outcome; more expensive outcomes include aligning at position 1 (41 fuel), position 3 (39 fuel), or position 10 (71 fuel).\n\nDetermine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible. How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\ncall() ->\n    {ok, File} = file:read_file(\"input.txt\"),\n    Input = string:tokens(binary_to_list(File), \",\\n\"),\n    Positions = lists:map(fun(X) -> list_to_integer(X) end, Input),\n    MinPos = lists:min(Positions),\n    MaxPos = lists:max(Positions),\n    Answer = lists:min([lists:sum(lists:map(fun(P) -> abs(P-X) end, Positions)) || X <- lists:seq(MinPos, MaxPos)]),\n    io:format(\"~p~n\", [Answer]).\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

The submarine computer challenges you to a nice game of Dirac Dice.\n\nThis game consists of a single die, two pawns, and a game board with a circular track containing ten spaces marked 1 through 10 clockwise. Each player's starting space is chosen randomly (your puzzle input). Player 1 goes first.\n\nPlayers take turns moving. On each player's turn, the player rolls the die three times and adds up the results. Then, the player moves their pawn that many times forward around the track (that is, moving clockwise on spaces in order of increasing value, wrapping back around to 1 after 10). So, if a player is on space 7 and they roll 2, 2, and 1, they would move forward 5 times, to spaces 8, 9, 10, 1, and finally stopping on 2.\n\nAfter each player moves, they increase their score by the value of the space their pawn stopped on. Players' scores start at 0. So, if the first player starts on space 7 and rolls a total of 5, they would stop on space 2 and add 2 to their score (for a total score of 2). The game immediately ends as a win for any player whose score reaches at least 1000.\n\nSince the first game is a practice game, the submarine opens a compartment labeled deterministic dice and a 100-sided die falls out. This die always rolls 1 first, then 2, then 3, and so on up to 100, after which it starts over at 1 again. Play using this die.\n\nFor example, given these starting positions:\n\nPlayer 1 starting position: 4\nPlayer 2 starting position: 8\nThis is how the game would go:\n\nPlayer 1 rolls 1+2+3 and moves to space 10 for a total score of 10.\nPlayer 2 rolls 4+5+6 and moves to space 3 for a total score of 3.\nPlayer 1 rolls 7+8+9 and moves to space 4 for a total score of 14.\nPlayer 2 rolls 10+11+12 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 9.\nPlayer 1 rolls 13+14+15 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 20.\nPlayer 2 rolls 16+17+18 and moves to space 7 for a total score of 16.\nPlayer 1 rolls 19+20+21 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 26.\nPlayer 2 rolls 22+23+24 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 22.\n...after many turns...\n\nPlayer 2 rolls 82+83+84 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 742.\nPlayer 1 rolls 85+86+87 and moves to space 4 for a total score of 990.\nPlayer 2 rolls 88+89+90 and moves to space 3 for a total score of 745.\nPlayer 1 rolls 91+92+93 and moves to space 10 for a final score, 1000.\nSince player 1 has at least 1000 points, player 1 wins and the game ends. At this point, the losing player had 745 points and the die had been rolled a total of 993 times; 745 * 993 = 739785.\n\nPlay a practice game using the deterministic 100-sided die. The moment either player wins, what do you get if you multiply the score of the losing player by the number of times the die was rolled during the game?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\ncall() ->\n    {ok, Data} = file:read_file(\"input.txt\"),\n    Lines = string:tokens(binary_to_list(Data), \"\\n\"),\n    Player1Start = list_to_integer(string:substr(lists:nth(1, Lines), 29, 3)),\n    Player2Start = list_to_integer(string:substr(lists:nth(2, Lines), 29, 3)),\n    Player1Pos = Player1Start,\n    Player2Pos = Player2Start,\n    Player1Score = 0,\n    Player2Score = 0,\n    DieRoll = 1,\n    RollCount = 0,\n    play(Player1Pos, Player2Pos, Player1Score, Player2Score, DieRoll, RollCount).\n\nplay(Player1Pos, Player2Pos, Player1Score, Player2Score, DieRoll, RollCount) ->\n    Rolls1 = DieRoll rem 100 + (DieRoll+1) rem 100 + (DieRoll+2) rem 100,\n    RollCount1 = RollCount + 3,\n    DieRoll1 = DieRoll + 3,\n    Player1Pos1 = (Player1Pos + Rolls1 - 1) rem 10 + 1,\n    Player1Score1 = Player1Score + Player1Pos1,\n    case Player1Score1 >= 1000 of\n        true -> io:format(\"Result: ~p~n\", [Player2Score*RollCount1]);\n        false -> Rolls2 = DieRoll1 rem 100 + (DieRoll1+1) rem 100 + (DieRoll1+2) rem 100,\n                  RollCount2 = RollCount1 + 3,\n                  DieRoll2 = DieRoll1 + 3,\n                  Player2Pos1 = (Player2Pos + Rolls2 - 1) rem 10 + 1,\n                  Player2Score1 = Player2Score + Player2Pos1,\n                  case Player2Score1 >= 1000 of\n                      true -> io:format(\"Result: ~p~n\", [Player1Score1 * RollCount2]);\n                      false -> play(Player1Pos1, Player2Pos1, Player1Score1, Player2Score1, DieRoll2, RollCount2)\n                  end\n    end.\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).\n\nThe Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.\n\nFor example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:\n\n1000\n2000\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n6000\n\n7000\n8000\n9000\n\n10000\nThis list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:\n\nThe first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.\nThe second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.\nThe third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.\nThe fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.\nThe fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.\nIn case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).\n\nFind the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\ncall() ->\n    {ok, File} = file:open(\"input.txt\", [read]),\n    {ok, Answer} = find_max_calories(File, 0, 0),\n    io:format(\"~p~n\", [Answer]),\n    file:close(File).\n\nfind_max_calories(File, MaxCalories, CurrentCalories) ->\n    case file:read_line(File) of\n        {ok, Line} ->\n            case Line of\n                \"\\n\" ->\n                    if CurrentCalories > MaxCalories ->\n                        find_max_calories(File, CurrentCalories, 0);\n                    true ->\n                        find_max_calories(File, MaxCalories, 0)\n                    end;\n                _ ->\n                    case list_to_integer(string:strip(Line, right, $\\n)) of\n                        {error, _} -> find_max_calories(File, MaxCalories, CurrentCalories);\n                        Calories -> find_max_calories(File, MaxCalories, CurrentCalories + Calories)\n                    end\n            end;\n        eof ->\n            if CurrentCalories > MaxCalories ->\n                {ok, CurrentCalories};\n            true ->\n                {ok, MaxCalories}\n            end\n    end.\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.\n\nRock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.\n\nAppreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. \"The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column--\" Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone's tent.\n\nThe second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.\n\nThe winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).\n\nSince you can't be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.\n\nFor example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:\n\nA Y\nB X\nC Z\nThis strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:\n\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).\nIn the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).\nThe third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.\nIn this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).\n\nWhat would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\ncall() ->\n    Input = \"input.txt\",\n    {ok, File} = file:read_file(Input),\n    Lines = string:tokens(binary_to_list(File), \"\\n\"),\n    TotalScore = calculate_score(Lines, 0),\n    io:format(\"~p~n\", [TotalScore]).\n\ncalculate_score([], Score) -> Score;\ncalculate_score([Line | Rest], Score) ->\n    [Opponent, Response] = string:tokens(Line, \" \"),\n    OpponentScore = case Opponent of\n                        \"A\" -> 1;\n                        \"B\" -> 2;\n                        \"C\" -> 3\n                    end,\n    ResponseScore = case Response of\n                        \"X\" -> 1;\n                        \"Y\" -> 2;\n                        \"Z\" -> 3\n                    end,\n    Outcome = case OpponentScore of\n                1 when ResponseScore == 2 -> 6;\n                2 when ResponseScore == 3 -> 6;\n                3 when ResponseScore == 1 -> 6;\n                _ when OpponentScore == ResponseScore -> 3;\n                _ -> 0\n              end,\n    calculate_score(Rest, Score + ResponseScore + Outcome).\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}

Unfortunately, that Elf didn't quite follow the packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.\n\nEach rucksack has two large compartments. All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments. The Elf that did the packing failed to follow this rule for exactly one item type per rucksack.\n\nThe Elves have made a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack (your puzzle input), but they need your help finding the errors. Every item type is identified by a single lowercase or uppercase letter (that is, a and A refer to different types of items).\n\nThe list of items for each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line. A given rucksack always has the same number of items in each of its two compartments, so the first half of the characters represent items in the first compartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the second compartment.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following list of contents from six rucksacks:\n\nvJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp\njqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL\nPmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg\nwMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn\nttgJtRGJQctTZtZT\nCrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw\nThe first rucksack contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp, which means its first compartment contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWr, while the second compartment contains the items hcsFMMfFFhFp. The only item type that appears in both compartments is lowercase p.\nThe second rucksack's compartments contain jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL and rsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL. The only item type that appears in both compartments is uppercase L.\nThe third rucksack's compartments contain PmmdzqPrV and vPwwTWBwg; the only common item type is uppercase P.\nThe fourth rucksack's compartments only share item type v.\nThe fifth rucksack's compartments only share item type t.\nThe sixth rucksack's compartments only share item type s.\nTo help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a priority:\n\nLowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.\nUppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.\nIn the above example, the priority of the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack is 16 (p), 38 (L), 42 (P), 22 (v), 20 (t), and 19 (s); the sum of these is 157.\n\nFind the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack.

He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to set up right now is the communication system.\n\nHowever, because he's heard you have significant experience dealing with signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem fixing it.\n\nAs if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.\n\nTo be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device receives one at a time.\n\nTo fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.\n\nThe device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.\n\nFor example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:\n\nmjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb\nAfter the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven't been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn't a marker.\n\nThe first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives.

The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.\n\nYou've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.\n\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n\nYou try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine (\"not powerful enough\") and where they're even sending you (\"the sky\") and why your map looks mostly blank (\"you sure ask a lot of questions\") and hang on did you just say the sky (\"of course, where do you think snow comes from\") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet (\"please hold still, we need to strap you in\").\n\nAs they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.\n\nThe newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.\n\nFor example:\n\n1abc2\npqr3stu8vwx\na1b2c3d4e5f\ntreb7uchet\nIn this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.\n\nConsider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?\n```\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Here is a solution of the challenge:\n```erlang\n-module(task).\n-export([call/0]).\n\ncall() ->\n    {ok, Data} = file:read_file(\"input.txt\"),\n    Lines = string:split(binary_to_list(Data), \"\\n\", all),\n    CalibrationValues = lists:map(fun get_calibration_value/1, Lines),\n    Sum = lists:sum(CalibrationValues),\n    io:format(\"~p~n\", [Sum]).\n\nget_calibration_value(Line) ->\n    Digits = [C || C <- Line, C >= $0, C =< $9],\n    case Digits of\n        [First | _] = All ->\n            Last = lists:last(All),\n            FirstDigit = First - $0,\n            LastDigit = Last - $0,\n            FirstDigit * 10 + LastDigit;\n        _ ->\n            0\n    end.\n```\n","role":"assistant"}]}
