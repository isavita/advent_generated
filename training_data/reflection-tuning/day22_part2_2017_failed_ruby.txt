Based on the given output, it seems that the solution for Part One is correct (5391), but the solution for Part Two is incorrect (2511418 instead of the expected 2511944). The error is likely in the implementation of the evolved virus behavior for Part Two. 

The main issues to address could be:

1. Incorrect state transitions: We need to ensure that the state changes follow the correct order (clean -> weakened -> infected -> flagged -> clean).
2. Direction changes: The virus carrier's direction change logic might be incorrect, especially for the new states (weakened and flagged).
3. Counting infections: We should only count when a node becomes infected, not when it's already infected or becomes weakened.
4. Number of iterations: We need to ensure we're running for exactly 10,000,000 bursts in Part Two.

To fix these issues, we'll need to carefully implement the new rules for Part Two, ensuring each state transition and direction change is correct, and that we're only counting new infections.
