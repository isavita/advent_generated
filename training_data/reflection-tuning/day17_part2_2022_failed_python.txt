Based on the given output, it seems that the Part 1 solution (309) is incorrect, while the Part 2 solution (1525364428678) might be correct. The main issue is likely in the implementation of the rock falling simulation for Part 1. 

To fix this, we should:
1. Ensure that the rock shapes and jet patterns are correctly implemented.
2. Verify that the rock falling logic, including collision detection and settling, is working properly.
3. Double-check the calculation of the tower height after 2022 rocks have fallen.

For Part 2, we need to implement a cycle detection algorithm to handle the large number of rocks (1000000000000) efficiently. This involves:
1. Detecting repeating patterns in the tower growth.
2. Calculating the height gain per cycle.
3. Extrapolating the final height based on the number of complete cycles and the remainder.

Let's implement a corrected solution addressing these points.
