To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input coordinates from the file and store them in a set for quick lookup.
2. Iterate through each cube in the set.
3. For each cube, check its six adjacent positions (up, down, left, right, front, back).
4. If an adjacent position is not in the set, it means that side is exposed, so we increment our surface area count.
5. After checking all cubes, return the total surface area count.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of cubes, as we only iterate through the cubes once and perform constant-time operations for each cube.
