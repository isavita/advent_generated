To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a combination of parsing the input, iterative approach for ingredient combinations, and calculation of scores. Here's the approach:

1. Parse the input file to extract ingredient properties.
2. Create a function to calculate the score for a given combination of ingredients.
3. Use nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of ingredients (ensuring they sum to 100 teaspoons).
4. For each combination, calculate the score and keep track of the highest score.
5. For Part Two, add a condition to check if the calorie count is exactly 500.
6. Optimize by using list comprehensions and built-in functions where possible.

This approach allows us to explore all possible combinations efficiently while keeping the code concise and readable.
