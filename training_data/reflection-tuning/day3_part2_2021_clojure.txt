To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we'll follow these steps:

1. Read the input file and parse each line into a vector of binary digits.
2. For Part 1:
   - Calculate the gamma rate by finding the most common bit in each position.
   - Calculate the epsilon rate by finding the least common bit in each position.
   - Multiply the decimal representations of gamma and epsilon rates.
3. For Part 2:
   - Implement a function to filter numbers based on bit criteria.
   - Use this function to find oxygen generator rating and CO2 scrubber rating.
   - Multiply these ratings to get the life support rating.

We'll use Clojure's efficient sequence operations and bit manipulation functions to keep the solution concise and performant.
