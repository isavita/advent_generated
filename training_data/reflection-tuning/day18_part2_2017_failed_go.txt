The error message indicates that there's an attempt to receive from a send-only channel, which is not allowed in Go. This suggests that there might be a misuse of channel directions in the code. To fix this, we need to ensure that we're using the correct channel direction (send-only or receive-only) in the appropriate places.

The error is occurring in a function that's likely trying to simulate the behavior of two programs running concurrently and communicating via channels. We need to make sure that the channels are properly defined and used in each goroutine.

To address this, we should:
1. Define bi-directional channels for communication between the two programs.
2. Pass send-only channels to the sending goroutine and receive-only channels to the receiving goroutine.
3. Ensure that the main goroutine uses the bi-directional channels for coordination.
4. Use proper channel closing mechanisms to avoid deadlocks.

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind.
