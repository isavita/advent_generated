To solve this problem, we need to simulate the pulse propagation through the network of modules. Here's the approach:

1. Parse the input to create a map of modules and their connections.
2. Implement each module type (broadcaster, flip-flop, conjunction) with its specific behavior.
3. Create a queue to handle pulses in the order they are sent.
4. Simulate pressing the button 1000 times, keeping track of low and high pulses sent.
5. For each button press, process all pulses until the queue is empty.
6. Calculate the final result by multiplying the total low and high pulses.

The key to efficiency is using appropriate data structures:
- Use a map for quick module lookup.
- Use a queue (implemented as a slice) for pulse processing.
- Use bitsets for flip-flop states and conjunction memory to save space and improve performance.
