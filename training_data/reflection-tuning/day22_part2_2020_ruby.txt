To solve this problem, we need to implement both the regular Combat game and the Recursive Combat game. Here's the approach:

1. Parse the input file to get the initial decks for both players.
2. Implement the regular Combat game for Part 1.
3. Implement the Recursive Combat game for Part 2, which includes:
   - Checking for repeated configurations to prevent infinite games
   - Recursively playing sub-games when conditions are met
4. Calculate the score of the winning player's deck
5. Run both parts and print the results

We'll use arrays to represent the decks and implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. For Part 2, we'll use recursion and a set to keep track of previous configurations.
