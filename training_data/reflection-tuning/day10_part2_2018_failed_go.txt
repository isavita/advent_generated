To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the initial positions and velocities of the points.
2. Simulate the movement of the points over time.
3. Find the moment when the points align to form a message (when they occupy the smallest area).
4. Visualize the message at that moment.
5. Calculate the number of seconds it took for the message to appear.

The key insight is that the message will appear when the points are closest together, forming a coherent shape. We can determine this by calculating the bounding box of all points at each step and finding the step with the smallest area.

For efficiency, we'll use a struct to represent each point, and we'll use slices to store and manipulate the data. We'll also implement a function to calculate the bounding box and its area.
