The error message indicates a NullPointerException at line 15 of the main.clj file, specifically in the 'move' function. This suggests that we're trying to call a method on a null object. Given the context of the problem, it's likely that we're not handling the input correctly or we're not initializing some data structure properly.

To fix this, we should ensure that:
1. All input is properly parsed and validated.
2. We initialize our data structures (like the current position and direction) before using them.
3. We handle edge cases, such as empty input or unexpected input formats.

Additionally, for Part Two, we need to keep track of all visited positions and check for the first repeated position. We should use a set for efficient lookups.
