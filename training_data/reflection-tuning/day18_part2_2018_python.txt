To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Read the initial state from the input file.
2. Implement a function to simulate one minute of changes.
3. For Part 1, run the simulation for 10 minutes and calculate the resource value.
4. For Part 2, we need to optimize for 1,000,000,000 minutes. The key insight here is that the pattern will likely repeat after some time. We can:
   a. Run the simulation until we detect a cycle.
   b. Calculate how many cycles will occur in 1,000,000,000 minutes.
   c. Fast-forward to the state that would exist after those cycles.
   d. Simulate the remaining minutes.
5. Calculate and return the final resource value.

We'll use a 2D list to represent the area and implement efficient neighbor counting using list comprehensions.
