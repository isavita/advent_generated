To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to extract the initial positions of the moons.
2. Create a structure to represent each moon with its position and velocity.
3. Implement functions to update velocity and position based on the given rules.
4. Simulate the motion for 1000 steps.
5. Calculate the total energy of the system after 1000 steps.

We'll use a Moon struct to represent each moon, and a slice of Moons to represent the system. We'll implement methods to update velocity and position, and a function to calculate energy. The main loop will simulate 1000 steps and then calculate the total energy.
