To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" to get the target row and column.
2. Implement a function to generate the next code based on the previous one.
3. Calculate the position of the target code in the sequence.
4. Generate codes until we reach the target position.

The key insight is that we don't need to generate the entire grid. We can calculate the position of any (row, column) pair in the sequence using a formula:
position = (row + column - 1) * (row + column - 2) / 2 + column

This formula comes from observing the pattern of how the diagonals are filled.

Once we have the position, we can generate codes sequentially until we reach that position.
