The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using a brute-force approach or an inefficient algorithm to solve the problem. This problem is a classic state-space search problem, which can be solved more efficiently using breadth-first search (BFS) with proper state representation and pruning.

To optimize the solution:
1. Use a more compact state representation to reduce memory usage and comparison time.
2. Implement efficient state hashing to avoid revisiting the same states.
3. Apply pruning techniques to reduce the number of states explored.
4. Use BFS instead of DFS to find the shortest path.
5. Implement symmetry reduction to further decrease the state space.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the execution time and prevent timeout issues.
