To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input to get the target area coordinates.
2. Simulate the probe's trajectory for various initial velocities.
3. Find the highest y position reached among all valid trajectories.

We can optimize by:
- Calculating the maximum x velocity (beyond which the probe will overshoot on the first step).
- Calculating the minimum x velocity (below which the probe will never reach the target area).
- Calculating the maximum y velocity (beyond which the probe will always overshoot).
- Calculating the minimum y velocity (below which the probe will undershoot on the first step).

We'll then iterate through these bounded ranges of velocities, simulate each trajectory, and keep track of the highest y position reached for valid trajectories.
