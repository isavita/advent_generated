To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we'll follow these steps:
1. Read and parse the input file, sorting the entries chronologically.
2. Process the sorted entries to create a map of guard IDs to their sleep patterns.
3. Implement both strategies to find the required guard and minute combinations.
4. Calculate and return the final answers for both parts.

We'll use Clojure's built-in functions for sorting, grouping, and reducing to efficiently process the data. We'll also use regular expressions to parse the input lines.
