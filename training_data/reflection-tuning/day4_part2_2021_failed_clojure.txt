Based on the error message, it appears that there's a NullPointerException occurring in the `score` function at line 20 of the main.clj file. This suggests that we're trying to call a method (getClass()) on a null object. 

The error is likely caused by trying to access an element that doesn't exist in a collection, or by not properly handling a case where a value might be null. To fix this, we need to ensure that we're properly checking for null values before accessing them, and that we're correctly handling all possible cases in our logic.

In the context of a bingo game, this could happen if we're trying to access a board or number that doesn't exist, or if we're not properly handling the case where no board has won yet. We should make sure our functions are robust enough to handle these edge cases.

Let's revise the code to include proper null checks and error handling, and ensure that all possible game states are accounted for.
