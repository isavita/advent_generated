To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider a few key points:

1. We need to implement the three types of dance moves: spin, exchange, and partner.
2. For Part One, we simply need to apply these moves to the initial string of programs.
3. For Part Two, doing the dance a billion times would be too slow. We need to find a pattern.
4. The key observation is that after a certain number of dances, the order will repeat.
5. We can find this cycle length by performing the dance until we see a repeated order.
6. Once we know the cycle length, we can calculate how many dances we need to perform after dividing 1 billion by the cycle length.

Here's the approach:
1. Implement the dance moves.
2. Perform the dance once for Part One.
3. For Part Two, find the cycle length.
4. Calculate the equivalent number of dances needed after 1 billion iterations.
5. Perform only the necessary number of dances to get the final order.
