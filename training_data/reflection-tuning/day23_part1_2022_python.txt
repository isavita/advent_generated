To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input to create a set of elf positions.
2. Implement the movement rules for each round.
3. Simulate 10 rounds of movement.
4. Find the smallest rectangle containing all elves after 10 rounds.
5. Count the empty ground tiles in this rectangle.

Key points for an efficient solution:
- Use a set to store elf positions for quick lookup and updates.
- Implement a function to check adjacent positions efficiently.
- Use a dictionary to track proposed moves and handle conflicts.
- Rotate the direction priorities using a deque for easy manipulation.
