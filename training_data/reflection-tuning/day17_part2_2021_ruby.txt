To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input to extract the target area coordinates.
2. Implement a function to simulate the probe's trajectory and check if it hits the target area.
3. For Part 1, we can use the fact that the maximum height is reached when the y velocity becomes 0 again. The maximum y velocity we can use is the absolute value of the lower y bound of the target area minus 1.
4. For Part 2, we need to iterate through possible x and y velocities and count how many hit the target area. We can optimize this by:
   - Limiting the x velocity range from 1 to the maximum x of the target area.
   - Limiting the y velocity range from the minimum y of the target area to the absolute value of the minimum y minus 1.

This approach avoids unnecessary calculations and provides an efficient solution for both parts.
