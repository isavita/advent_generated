To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input to get the target area coordinates.
2. Simulate the probe's trajectory for various initial velocities.
3. Find the highest y position reached among all valid trajectories.

The key insights are:
- The x and y components of the motion can be treated independently.
- For maximum height, we want the highest initial y velocity that still hits the target.
- The probe will always return to y=0 on its way down, and the step after that will have a y velocity of -(initial_y_velocity + 1).
- The highest possible initial y velocity is one that makes the probe land on the bottom edge of the target area in a single step after returning to y=0.

With these insights, we can calculate the maximum initial y velocity directly, without simulating all possible trajectories.
