To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read and parse the input file to extract the time and distance for each race.
2. For each race, calculate the number of ways to beat the record.
3. To find the number of ways to beat the record for a single race:
   - Iterate through possible hold times from 0 to the race time.
   - For each hold time, calculate the distance traveled.
   - Count how many of these distances beat the record.
4. Multiply the counts for all races to get the final answer.

We can optimize by using Clojure's sequence operations and avoiding unnecessary calculations. We'll use `filter` to count winning scenarios efficiently.
