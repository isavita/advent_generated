The error message indicates a syntax error in a regular expression, specifically in a look-behind group. The problem is that look-behind groups in regular expressions need to have a fixed length, which isn't possible with the current approach. Instead of using a complex regex, we can simplify our approach by using a more straightforward string manipulation and checking method. We'll iterate through the digits of the number, checking for adjacent pairs and ensuring they're not part of a larger group.
