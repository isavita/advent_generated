Based on the given output, it seems that Part 1 is correct (1533), but Part 2 is likely incorrect (3349999993233). The issue with Part 2 is probably related to the large number of generations (50 billion) that need to be simulated. A direct simulation approach would be too slow and memory-intensive.

To fix this, we need to optimize the solution for Part 2. One common pattern in such problems is that after a certain number of generations, the pattern of plants stabilizes and starts moving at a constant rate. We can detect this pattern and then use mathematical calculations to determine the final state without simulating all 50 billion generations.

The approach would be:
1. Simulate generations until we detect a repeating pattern.
2. Calculate the rate at which the pattern is moving.
3. Use this rate to calculate the final position after 50 billion generations.

This optimization should significantly reduce the computation time and provide the correct answer for Part 2.
