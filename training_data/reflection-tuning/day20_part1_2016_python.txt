To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse each line into start and end ranges.
2. Sort the ranges based on their start values.
3. Merge overlapping ranges to simplify our list.
4. Iterate through the merged ranges to find the first gap, which will be the lowest unblocked IP.

This approach allows us to handle large ranges of IPs efficiently without having to check every single IP. By merging overlapping ranges, we reduce the number of comparisons needed.
