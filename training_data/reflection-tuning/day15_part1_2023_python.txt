To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input from the file as a single string.
2. Split the string by commas to get individual steps.
3. Implement the HASH algorithm as a separate function for clarity and reusability.
4. Apply the HASH algorithm to each step and sum the results.

The HASH algorithm can be implemented as a simple loop that processes each character of the input string. We'll use ord() to get the ASCII code of each character.

To optimize for efficiency, we'll use list comprehension to apply the HASH function to all steps at once, then use the built-in sum() function to calculate the final result.
