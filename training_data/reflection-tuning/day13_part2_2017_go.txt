To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:

1. Parse the input file to create a map of layer depths to their ranges.
2. For Part 1:
   - Iterate through each layer from 0 to the maximum depth.
   - For each layer, check if a scanner is at the top position when the packet arrives.
   - If caught, add the severity (depth * range) to the total.
3. For Part 2:
   - Use a loop to increment the delay until we find a delay where we're not caught.
   - For each delay, check all layers to see if we're caught at any point.
   - Optimize by using the modulo operator to determine scanner position instead of simulating movement.

The key optimization is using the formula `(depth + delay) % (2 * (range - 1)) == 0` to check if we're caught, which avoids the need for complex scanner movement simulation.
