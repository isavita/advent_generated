The main issue in the previous code appears to be related to syntax errors with symbols. In Ruby, when using symbols as method arguments or in case statements, we need to use the symbol literal syntax (`:symbol`) without additional quotes or pipes. The error messages indicate issues with unexpected colons and unmatched pipes, which suggests that the symbols were not properly formatted.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Correct the symbol syntax in the `count_neighbors` method calls.
2. Adjust the case statement to use proper symbol syntax.
3. Ensure that the `count_resources` method is using the correct symbol syntax.

Additionally, we should initialize the `new_grid` variable in the `next_state` method and ensure that all necessary variables are initialized in the `count_resources` method.
