To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the instructions from the input file.
2. Implement a function to execute each instruction type (set, sub, mul, jnz).
3. Keep track of the number of times the 'mul' instruction is invoked.
4. Execute the program by iterating through the instructions, updating registers and the instruction pointer as needed.
5. Return the count of 'mul' instructions executed.

We'll use a dictionary to represent the registers, and a list to store the instructions. We'll implement a function for each instruction type and use a main loop to execute the program.
