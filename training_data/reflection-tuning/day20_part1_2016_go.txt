To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse each line into a range of blocked IPs.
2. Sort the ranges based on their start values.
3. Merge overlapping ranges to simplify the blocked IP list.
4. Iterate through the merged ranges to find the first gap, which will be the lowest unblocked IP.

The key to efficiency here is merging the ranges. This will reduce the number of comparisons we need to make and allow us to find the first unblocked IP quickly.
