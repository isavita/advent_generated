The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely too computationally expensive, probably due to inefficient algorithms or unnecessary iterations. To address this, we need to optimize the solution. Here are some potential improvements:

1. Use a more efficient method for tile matching and arrangement.
2. Implement memoization or caching to avoid redundant calculations.
3. Optimize the sea monster detection algorithm.
4. Use bitwise operations for faster pattern matching.
5. Implement early termination conditions where possible.

I'll focus on creating a more efficient solution that addresses these points, particularly optimizing the tile arrangement and sea monster detection.
