To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the initial state from the input file.
2. Implement the rules for bug evolution.
3. Keep track of all layouts we've seen.
4. Repeat the evolution process until we find a duplicate layout.
5. Calculate the biodiversity rating for the duplicate layout.

We can represent the layout as a string for easy comparison and hashing. We'll use a set to keep track of seen layouts for efficient lookup. For the evolution process, we'll create helper functions to count adjacent bugs and apply the rules. The biodiversity rating can be calculated by iterating through the layout and summing powers of 2 for tiles with bugs.
