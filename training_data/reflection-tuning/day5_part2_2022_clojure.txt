To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to separate the initial stack configuration and the move instructions.
2. Create a function to parse the initial stack configuration into a vector of vectors (each inner vector representing a stack).
3. Create a function to parse and execute move instructions.
4. Implement the CrateMover 9001 logic, which moves multiple crates at once while maintaining their order.
5. After executing all moves, collect the top crate from each stack to form the final answer.

We'll use Clojure's built-in functions like `slurp`, `split-at`, `reduce`, and `map` to efficiently process the input and manipulate the data structures.
