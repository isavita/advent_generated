To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file line by line
2. Parse each line into opponent's move and our move
3. Calculate the score for each round based on the given rules
4. Sum up all the scores

For Part 1:
- We'll create a map for move scores and outcome scores
- Calculate score based on our move and the outcome

For Part 2:
- We'll create a map for required outcomes and a map for what move to choose based on opponent's move and required outcome
- Calculate score based on the chosen move and the required outcome

We can use Clojure's file reading capabilities, map functions, and reduce to efficiently solve this problem.
