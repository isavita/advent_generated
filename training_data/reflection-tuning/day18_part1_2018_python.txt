To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the initial state from the input file
2. Implement the rules for changing each acre
3. Simulate the changes for 10 minutes
4. Count the number of wooded acres and lumberyards
5. Calculate the total resource value

We can represent the lumber collection area as a 2D list of characters. For each minute, we'll create a new 2D list to store the next state, applying the rules to each acre based on its current neighbors. We'll use helper functions to count neighbors and apply rules for cleaner code.

To optimize, we can:
- Use list comprehensions for efficient 2D list operations
- Use a set of directions for neighbor checking instead of nested loops
- Use Counter from collections to quickly count acre types
