To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse it into a 2D vector of integers.
2. Count all the trees on the edge of the grid, as they are always visible.
3. For each interior tree, check its visibility in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
4. To check visibility, we can use the `reduce` function to compare the tree's height with the maximum height encountered so far in each direction.
5. If the tree is visible from any direction, increment our count.
6. Finally, return the total count of visible trees.

This approach ensures we only traverse the grid once for interior trees, making it efficient for large inputs.
