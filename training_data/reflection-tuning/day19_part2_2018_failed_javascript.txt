The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to a brute-force approach or an infinite loop. For this type of problem involving instruction execution and register manipulation, the key is to simulate the program execution efficiently.

To improve performance:
1. We should use an array to represent the registers for faster access.
2. Implement each opcode as a separate function for clarity and potential optimization.
3. Use a switch statement for faster opcode execution.
4. Avoid unnecessary loops or iterations.
5. For Part Two, we need to be careful about potential long-running calculations and might need to identify patterns or implement a way to fast-forward through repetitive cycles.

The solution should focus on accurately simulating the instruction pointer binding and the execution of each instruction, while being mindful of potential performance bottlenecks.
