The previous solution likely underestimated the number of affected points. The error message shows 650 points, which seems low for a 50x50 grid. The issue might be in how the tractor beam's effect is calculated or counted. 

To fix this, we should:
1. Ensure we're correctly interpreting the Intcode program output.
2. Properly count all points affected by the beam, including edge cases.
3. Double-check the range of coordinates we're scanning (0 to 49 for both X and Y).
4. Make sure we're not accidentally skipping any points or rows.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind.
