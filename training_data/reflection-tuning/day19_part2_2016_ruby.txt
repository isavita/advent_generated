To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a mathematical approach rather than simulating the entire process. For Part Two, we can observe a pattern:

1. The winning position follows a specific sequence based on the number of elves.
2. This sequence resets every time the number of elves reaches a power of 3.
3. The pattern is: 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...

We can use this pattern to calculate the winning position directly without simulating the entire process. Here's how we can implement this:

1. Find the largest power of 3 that's less than or equal to the number of elves.
2. Calculate the difference between the number of elves and this power of 3.
3. Use this difference to determine the winning position based on the observed pattern.

This approach will be much faster than simulating the process, especially for large numbers of elves.
