The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to an overly complex algorithm or unnecessary iterations. To fix this, we should focus on optimizing the solution by:

1. Using an efficient data structure to represent the dependencies between steps.
2. Implementing a topological sort algorithm that efficiently processes the steps.
3. Avoiding unnecessary iterations or recursive calls.

A more efficient approach would be to:
1. Parse the input and create a map of dependencies.
2. Maintain a set of available steps.
3. Iteratively select and process the alphabetically first available step.
4. Update the available steps after each selection.

This approach should run in O(N log N) time, where N is the number of steps, which should be much faster than the previous solution.
