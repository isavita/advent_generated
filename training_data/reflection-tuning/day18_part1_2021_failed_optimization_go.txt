The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to excessive recursion or unnecessary computations. To address this, we can optimize the solution by:

1. Using a more efficient data structure to represent snailfish numbers, such as a binary tree or a custom struct.
2. Implementing the reduction process (explode and split) iteratively rather than recursively to avoid stack overflow.
3. Optimizing the addition and magnitude calculation processes.
4. Using efficient string parsing techniques to convert input into our data structure.

I'll implement a solution using a custom struct to represent snailfish numbers and use iterative methods for reduction and other operations.
