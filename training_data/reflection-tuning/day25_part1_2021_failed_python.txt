The previous solution likely had an issue with the stopping condition for the simulation. The error output of 230 suggests that the simulation might have stopped prematurely or continued for too long. To fix this, we need to ensure that we're correctly checking if any sea cucumbers moved in each step, and only stopping when no movement occurs.

Additionally, the solution might not have properly handled the wrapping of sea cucumbers around the edges of the map. We need to implement this wraparound behavior correctly.

To address these issues, we should:
1. Implement a function to move each type of sea cucumber (east-moving and south-moving).
2. Ensure that we're checking for movement in both directions before concluding a step.
3. Implement proper wraparound logic for both horizontal and vertical movements.
4. Use a flag to track whether any movement occurred in a step, and only stop when no movement happens.

Let's implement a corrected solution with these considerations in mind.
