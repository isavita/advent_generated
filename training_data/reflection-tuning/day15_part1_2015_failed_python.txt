The previous solution seems to have produced a single number (9409920) as output, which is likely the score of a single cookie combination. However, the problem asks for the highest-scoring cookie possible. The error here is probably that the code only calculated one combination or didn't properly search through all possible combinations to find the maximum score.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Implement a way to generate all possible combinations of ingredients that sum to 100 teaspoons.
2. Calculate the score for each combination.
3. Keep track of and return the maximum score found.

We can use itertools.combinations_with_replacement to generate all possible combinations efficiently. Then, we'll calculate the score for each combination and keep track of the maximum.
