To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the initial configuration from the input file.
2. Implement a function to simulate one step of the animation.
3. Create a function to count the number of lights that are on.
4. Run the simulation for 100 steps and count the lights for Part 1.
5. Modify the simulation to keep the corner lights always on for Part 2.
6. Run the modified simulation for 100 steps and count the lights again.

We'll use a 2D array to represent the grid, where true represents an "on" light and false represents an "off" light. We'll use the fs module to read the input file.

For efficiency, we'll create a new grid for each step instead of modifying the existing one. This allows us to check the current state without worrying about changes affecting neighboring cells.
