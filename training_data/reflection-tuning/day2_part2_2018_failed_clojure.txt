To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we'll follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and split it into lines.
2. For Part 1:
   - Create a function to count occurrences of each character in a string.
   - Use this to count how many IDs have exactly two of any letter and three of any letter.
   - Multiply these counts for the checksum.
3. For Part 2:
   - Create a function to compare two strings and return common characters if they differ by exactly one character.
   - Use combination to compare all pairs of IDs efficiently.
   - Return the common characters of the first matching pair found.
4. Combine both parts in the main function and print the results.

This approach is efficient as it minimizes iterations over the input and uses Clojure's built-in functions for most operations.
