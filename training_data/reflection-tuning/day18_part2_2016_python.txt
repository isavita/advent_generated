To solve this problem efficiently, we can observe that:
1. We only need to keep track of the current row to generate the next row.
2. We don't need to store all rows in memory, just count the safe tiles as we go.
3. The rules for trap generation can be simplified to a single XOR operation.
4. We can use bitwise operations for faster computation.

The approach will be:
1. Convert the input string to a binary representation (0 for safe, 1 for trap).
2. Use bitwise operations to efficiently generate each new row.
3. Count safe tiles in each row as we generate it.
4. Repeat the process for the required number of rows.

This solution will be memory-efficient (O(1) space complexity) and time-efficient (O(n*m) time complexity, where n is the number of rows and m is the width of each row).
