Based on the incorrect output, it seems the previous solution might have had issues with properly parsing the regex and building the map. The part 1 answer of 1 is too low, and the part 2 answer of 0 suggests that the code isn't correctly counting rooms or tracking distances.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. The regex is properly parsed, including handling nested parentheses and branches.
2. The map is correctly built as we traverse the regex.
3. We're accurately tracking the distance to each room.
4. We're correctly identifying the furthest room (for part 1) and counting rooms with a path of at least 1000 doors (for part 2).

I'll rewrite the solution focusing on these aspects, using a depth-first search approach to explore all possible paths.
