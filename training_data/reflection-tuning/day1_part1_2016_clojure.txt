To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt"
2. Parse the instructions into a sequence of turns and steps
3. Keep track of the current position and direction
4. Update the position based on each instruction
5. Calculate the Manhattan distance from the origin to the final position

We can represent the direction as a vector [x y], where:
- North = [0 1]
- East = [1 0]
- South = [0 -1]
- West = [-1 0]

We'll use a map to store the current state (position and direction) and update it with each instruction. Finally, we'll calculate the Manhattan distance using the absolute sum of the final coordinates.
