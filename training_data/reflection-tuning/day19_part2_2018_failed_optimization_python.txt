The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to a brute-force approach or an infinite loop. For this type of problem involving a custom instruction set and register manipulation, the key to optimization is often to identify patterns or shortcuts in the execution flow.

Given that we're dealing with a custom instruction set and register manipulation, a more efficient approach would be to:

1. Implement the instruction set as a dictionary of functions for quick lookup and execution.
2. Use a while loop instead of a for loop to allow for dynamic instruction pointer manipulation.
3. Implement a mechanism to detect loops or patterns in the execution to potentially skip redundant calculations.
4. For Part Two, instead of re-running the entire program with a different initial value, we could analyze the code to understand how the initial value affects the final result and potentially derive a mathematical formula or shortcut.

The revised solution should be able to handle both parts of the problem efficiently.
