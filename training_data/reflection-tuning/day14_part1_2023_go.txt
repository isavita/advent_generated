To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Read the input from "input.txt"
2. Parse the input into a 2D slice of runes
3. Tilt the platform north by moving all 'O' rocks as far up as possible
4. Calculate the load on the north support beams

The key to efficiency here is to process the grid column by column, moving rocks up in each column. This way, we only need to iterate through the grid once.

For calculating the load, we can use the formula: load = (total_rows - current_row) for each 'O' rock.
