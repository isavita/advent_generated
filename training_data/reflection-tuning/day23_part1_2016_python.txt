To solve this problem, we need to implement an assembunny interpreter that can handle the new 'tgl' instruction. Here's the approach:

1. Read the instructions from the input file.
2. Initialize registers (a, b, c, d) with 'a' set to 7 (the number of eggs).
3. Implement a function to execute each instruction type (cpy, inc, dec, jnz, tgl).
4. Create a main loop to iterate through the instructions, executing them and updating the program counter.
5. Handle the 'tgl' instruction by modifying other instructions in the program.
6. After executing all instructions, return the value in register 'a'.

The key challenges are:
- Implementing the 'tgl' instruction correctly, including handling out-of-bounds toggles.
- Ensuring that toggled instructions are executed correctly in subsequent runs.
- Handling potential infinite loops (though not explicitly mentioned in the problem).

Let's implement this solution:
