To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the instruction pointer binding and the list of instructions.
2. Implement the different opcodes (seti, setr, addi, addr, etc.).
3. Create a function to execute the program, keeping track of the registers and instruction pointer.
4. Run the program until it halts (when the instruction pointer goes out of bounds).
5. Return the value in register 0 at the end of execution.

The key is to carefully manage the instruction pointer, updating it before and after each instruction execution as described in the problem statement.
