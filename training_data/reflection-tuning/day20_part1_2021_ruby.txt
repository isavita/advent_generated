The previous solution likely had an issue with handling the infinite nature of the image or with correctly applying the enhancement algorithm. The output of 5577 seems too low for a realistic answer, considering the complexity of the problem. The main areas to focus on would be:

1. Properly expanding the image boundaries to account for the infinite nature.
2. Correctly implementing the enhancement algorithm, especially the binary conversion of the 3x3 grid.
3. Handling the edge cases where the infinite background might flip between light and dark pixels.

To address these issues, I would implement a solution that:
- Expands the image by a sufficient margin in each direction before each enhancement.
- Carefully implements the enhancement algorithm, including correct binary conversion.
- Tracks and updates the state of the infinite background pixels.
