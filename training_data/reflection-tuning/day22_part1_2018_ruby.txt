To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file to get the depth and target coordinates.
2. Create a function to calculate the geologic index for each region.
3. Create a function to calculate the erosion level for each region.
4. Create a function to determine the type of each region.
5. Calculate the risk level for each region in the rectangle from (0,0) to the target.
6. Sum up all the risk levels.

We can optimize by:
- Using memoization to store calculated geologic indices and erosion levels.
- Only calculating values for the required rectangle, not the entire cave system.
