Based on the output, it seems the previous solution found the 64th key at index 17016. However, this result is likely incorrect as the problem description suggests that the index should be much higher (in the example, it was 22728).

The issue might be in how the solution is checking for the five-of-a-kind sequence. It's possible that the code is not properly checking the next 1000 hashes for the five-of-a-kind sequence, or it might be incorrectly identifying triples or quintuples.

To fix this, we should ensure that:
1. We're correctly identifying triples in the current hash.
2. We're properly checking the next 1000 hashes for the corresponding quintuple.
3. We're keeping track of the number of keys found correctly.
4. We're not stopping prematurely and are checking all necessary hashes.

I'll provide a revised solution that addresses these potential issues.
