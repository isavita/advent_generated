To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the instruction pointer binding and the list of instructions.
2. Implement a function for each opcode (seti, setr, addi, addr, etc.).
3. Create a virtual machine that can execute these instructions.
4. Run the program until it halts (when the instruction pointer goes out of bounds).
5. Return the value in register 0 at the end of execution.

The approach will be to create a struct to represent the machine state, including registers and the instruction pointer. We'll implement methods for each opcode and a method to execute a single instruction. The main loop will continue executing instructions until the program halts.
