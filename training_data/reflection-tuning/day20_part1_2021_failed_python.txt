The previous solution likely had an issue with handling the infinite nature of the image or with correctly applying the enhancement algorithm. The output of 6712 seems too low for this problem, suggesting that the algorithm might not have been applied correctly or the infinite nature of the image wasn't properly accounted for.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. We properly pad the input image with a sufficient border of dark pixels to simulate the infinite nature.
2. We correctly apply the enhancement algorithm to each pixel, considering its 3x3 neighborhood.
3. We handle the edge cases where the infinite background might flip between light and dark pixels in each iteration.
4. We apply the enhancement algorithm twice as specified in the problem.

I'll rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind.
