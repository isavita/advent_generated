The error message indicates a SyntaxError related to an invalid destructuring assignment target. This typically occurs when trying to destructure an array or object in an unexpected way. In this case, it seems the error is in a function that's trying to destructure an array as a parameter.

The specific line causing the error is:

```javascript
([-y, x, z]) => [-y, x, z],
```

This syntax is not valid for arrow function parameters. To fix this, we need to change the destructuring pattern to a valid one. Instead of trying to negate y in the parameter list, we should do it inside the function body.

I'll rewrite this part of the code to use a valid destructuring pattern and perform the negation inside the function body. This should resolve the syntax error while maintaining the intended functionality.
