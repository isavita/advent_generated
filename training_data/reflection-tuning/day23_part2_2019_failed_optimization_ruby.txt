The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient or stuck in an infinite loop. For a problem involving network simulation with 50 computers, the key to optimization is likely in how we handle the simulation of each computer and the packet transmission.

To address this, we should:
1. Implement an efficient way to simulate all 50 computers concurrently.
2. Avoid unnecessary loops or computations.
3. Implement a smart way to detect when the network is idle.
4. Use a data structure that allows for quick packet queuing and dequeuing.

The solution should simulate the network in rounds, where each round processes all computers once. We'll use a queue for each computer's packet list and implement the NAT functionality as described. We'll also add a mechanism to detect when the network is idle and when to stop the simulation.
