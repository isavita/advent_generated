The previous solution likely didn't correctly implement the spinlock algorithm or didn't properly track the position after 2017. The output 1447 suggests that the algorithm might have been close but missed some crucial steps or didn't correctly handle the circular nature of the buffer.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. We're correctly implementing the circular buffer, possibly using a list and modulo arithmetic.
2. We're accurately tracking the current position after each insertion.
3. We're inserting values in the correct order and position.
4. We're performing exactly 2017 insertions.
5. After the insertions, we're finding the value immediately after 2017 in the buffer.

I'll implement a solution that carefully follows these steps, using a list to represent the buffer and modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature efficiently.
