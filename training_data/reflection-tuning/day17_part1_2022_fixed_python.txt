The previous solution likely had an issue with the simulation of the falling rocks or the calculation of the tower height. The error of 3101 suggests that the height was slightly overestimated. This could be due to:

1. Incorrect handling of rock shapes or their placement
2. Miscounting the number of rocks or cycles
3. Off-by-one error in calculating the final height

To fix this, we need to ensure:
- Accurate representation of rock shapes
- Correct simulation of rock falling and jet stream effects
- Proper tracking of the tower height after each rock settles
- Accurate count of 2022 rocks

I'll provide a revised solution that carefully implements these aspects, paying special attention to the rock shapes, movement rules, and height calculation.
