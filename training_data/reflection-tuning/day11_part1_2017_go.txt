To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt".
2. Parse the input into individual steps.
3. Keep track of the position using a coordinate system.
4. Calculate the final position after all steps.
5. Determine the shortest path from the origin to the final position.

For the coordinate system, we can use a 3D coordinate system (x, y, z) where:
- ne: (1, 0, -1)
- se: (1, -1, 0)
- s:  (0, -1, 1)
- sw: (-1, 0, 1)
- nw: (-1, 1, 0)
- n:  (0, 1, -1)

The shortest path is the maximum absolute value among the final coordinates.
