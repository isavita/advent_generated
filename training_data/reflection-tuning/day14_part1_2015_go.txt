To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract information about each reindeer.
2. Simulate the race for 2503 seconds.
3. Calculate the distance traveled by each reindeer.
4. Find the maximum distance traveled among all reindeer.

We can create a struct to represent each reindeer, containing its speed, fly time, and rest time. Then, we'll implement a function to calculate the distance traveled by a reindeer in a given time. Finally, we'll iterate through all reindeer, calculate their distances, and keep track of the maximum.
