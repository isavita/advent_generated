To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file and parse it into a 2D vector of characters.
2. Identify all the gear symbols (*) in the schematic.
3. For each gear, find adjacent numbers (including diagonally).
4. If a gear has exactly two adjacent numbers, multiply them to get the gear ratio.
5. Sum up all the gear ratios.

We'll use helper functions to:
- Read and parse the input file
- Find adjacent positions
- Extract full numbers from the schematic
- Calculate gear ratios

The main function will tie everything together and compute the final sum.
