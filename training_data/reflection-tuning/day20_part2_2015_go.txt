To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a mathematical approach rather than simulating the entire process. We'll use the concept of divisors and their sums.

For Part 1:
1. We'll iterate through house numbers.
2. For each house, we'll calculate the sum of its divisors multiplied by 10.
3. We'll stop when we find a house that receives at least as many presents as the input number.

For Part 2:
1. We'll use a similar approach, but with some modifications.
2. We'll only consider divisors up to 50 (since each Elf stops after 50 houses).
3. We'll multiply the sum by 11 instead of 10.

To optimize, we can use a sieve-like approach to calculate divisors for all numbers up to a certain limit, but for simplicity, we'll calculate divisors for each house individually.
