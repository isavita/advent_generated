To solve this problem, we need to simulate the beam's path through the contraption. Here's the approach:

1. Read the input from "input.txt" and store it as a 2D grid.
2. Create a function to move the beam and track its path.
3. Use a set to keep track of energized tiles.
4. Use a set to keep track of visited positions and directions to avoid infinite loops.
5. Implement the logic for beam reflection and splitting based on encountered symbols.
6. Start the beam from the top-left corner moving right.
7. Count the number of unique energized tiles.

We'll use a recursive approach for the beam movement, which will handle splitting naturally. To optimize, we'll use sets for fast lookups and avoid unnecessary iterations.
