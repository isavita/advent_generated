To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the replacement rules and the medicine molecule.
2. For each replacement rule, find all occurrences of the "from" part in the medicine molecule.
3. For each occurrence, create a new molecule by replacing that occurrence with the "to" part.
4. Keep track of all unique molecules created.
5. Count the number of unique molecules.

We can use a Set to store unique molecules efficiently. Regular expressions can be used to find all occurrences of a substring in the medicine molecule.
