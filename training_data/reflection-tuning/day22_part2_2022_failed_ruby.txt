The error message indicates that there's an undefined local variable or method `current_face` in the `move` method. This suggests that `current_face` is not properly defined or accessible within the scope of the `move` method. To fix this, we need to ensure that `current_face` is properly defined and accessible. It's likely that `current_face` should be an instance variable (`@current_face`) or a parameter passed to the `move` method.

Additionally, the error occurs in a block within the `move` method, which suggests that we might need to restructure the method to properly handle the cube faces and wrapping logic.

To address this, we'll:
1. Define `@current_face` as an instance variable
2. Update the `move` method to handle cube face transitions
3. Implement proper wrapping logic for the cube
4. Ensure all necessary variables are properly initialized and accessible
