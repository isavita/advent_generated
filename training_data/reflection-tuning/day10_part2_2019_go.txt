To solve this problem, we need to approach it in two parts:

1. Find the best location for the monitoring station (Part 1)
2. Simulate the vaporization process and find the 200th asteroid (Part 2)

For Part 1:
- We'll read the asteroid map from the input file.
- For each asteroid, we'll calculate the number of other asteroids it can see.
- To do this efficiently, we'll use the concept of relative prime positions and a set to store unique angles.
- The asteroid that can see the most other asteroids is our best location.

For Part 2:
- We'll use the best location found in Part 1 as the center of our laser.
- We'll calculate the angle and distance of each asteroid relative to the laser.
- We'll sort the asteroids by angle (clockwise from vertical) and then by distance.
- We'll simulate the vaporization process, keeping track of the order.
- We'll find the 200th asteroid and calculate its score.

This approach should be efficient as it avoids unnecessary calculations and uses appropriate data structures.
