To solve this problem, we need to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm with some modifications. Here's the approach:

1. Read the passcode from the input file.
2. Implement a function to calculate the MD5 hash and determine open doors.
3. Use a queue to perform BFS, storing the current position and path.
4. For each step, check all possible moves (up, down, left, right) based on open doors.
5. If we reach the vault (3,3), update the shortest path and continue searching for longer paths.
6. Keep track of the longest path length.
7. Terminate the search when there are no more possible moves.

This approach will efficiently find both the shortest path and the length of the longest path in a single pass.
