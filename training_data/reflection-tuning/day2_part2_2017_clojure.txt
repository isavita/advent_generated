To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse it into a sequence of sequences (rows of numbers).
2. For Part 1:
   - For each row, find the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
   - Sum these differences to get the checksum.
3. For Part 2:
   - For each row, find the pair of numbers where one evenly divides the other.
   - Perform the division and add the result to a running total.
4. Print both results.

We'll use Clojure's built-in functions like `slurp`, `clojure.string/split`, `map`, `apply`, and `reduce` to efficiently process the data. We'll also create helper functions for each part to keep the code modular and readable.
