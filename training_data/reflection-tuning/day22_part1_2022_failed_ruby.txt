The previous output of 1204 seems to be incorrect for this problem. The issue likely stems from an incorrect calculation of the final password. The password should be calculated as 1000 times the row, plus 4 times the column, plus the facing value. 

The error could be due to:
1. Incorrect tracking of the current position (row and column)
2. Improper handling of wrapping around the map
3. Misinterpretation of the facing direction values
4. Incorrect calculation of the final password

To fix this, we need to ensure:
1. Proper parsing of the map and instructions
2. Correct movement logic, including wrapping around the edges
3. Accurate tracking of position and facing
4. Correct calculation of the final password

I'll provide a revised solution that addresses these potential issues.
