Based on the task description, it seems the previous solution might have had issues with correctly counting the characters in the code representation versus the in-memory representation of strings. The main challenges here are:

1. Correctly counting escaped characters (\\, \", and \x followed by two hex digits) in the code representation.
2. Properly interpreting these escaped characters when counting the in-memory representation.
3. Handling the opening and closing quotes in the code representation but not in the in-memory representation.

To address these issues, we need to implement two separate counting functions: one for the code representation and one for the in-memory representation. We'll use regular expressions to identify and count the escaped characters correctly.
