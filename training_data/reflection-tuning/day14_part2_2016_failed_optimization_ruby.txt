The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, probably due to repeatedly calculating MD5 hashes for the same inputs. To optimize this, we can implement a caching mechanism for the MD5 hashes. Additionally, for Part Two, where we need to perform 2016 additional hashings, we can use memoization to store the results of stretched hashes.

Another optimization could be to use a sliding window approach for checking the next 1000 hashes, rather than recalculating all 1000 hashes for each potential key.

Lastly, we can use more efficient data structures like sets for storing and checking quintuplets, which should speed up the lookup process.
