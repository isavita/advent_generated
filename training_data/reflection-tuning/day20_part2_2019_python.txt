The error message indicates that the program is failing when trying to find the starting position 'AA' in the portal_pairs dictionary. This suggests that the 'AA' portal might not be present in the dictionary, or it's not being correctly identified during the maze parsing process.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that:
1. The maze parsing correctly identifies all portals, including 'AA' and 'ZZ'.
2. We handle the case where 'AA' might not be found in the portal_pairs dictionary.

Additionally, for Part Two of the problem, we need to implement the recursive maze logic, which wasn't present in the previous solution. We'll need to modify the BFS algorithm to handle different levels of the maze and the rules for moving between levels.
