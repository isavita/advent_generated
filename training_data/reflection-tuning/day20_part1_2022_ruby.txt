To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt"
2. Create a list of numbers with their original indices
3. Implement the mixing process
4. Find the position of 0 after mixing
5. Calculate the sum of the 1000th, 2000th, and 3000th numbers after 0

The key to efficiently implementing this is to use a data structure that allows for easy insertion and deletion. We'll use an array of [value, original_index] pairs. To handle the circular nature of the list, we'll use modulo arithmetic when calculating new positions.
