To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to extract rules, your ticket, and nearby tickets.
2. Create a function to check if a value is valid for any field.
3. For Part 1, sum up all invalid values in nearby tickets.
4. For Part 2:
   - Discard invalid tickets
   - Create a set of possible fields for each position
   - Use process of elimination to determine the exact field for each position
   - Multiply the values of "departure" fields on your ticket
5. Implement the solution using sets and dictionaries for efficient lookups

The key to efficiency here is using sets for quick membership tests and avoiding unnecessary iterations.
