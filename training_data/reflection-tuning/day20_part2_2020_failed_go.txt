The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to a brute-force approach or excessive nested loops. To address this, we need to optimize the algorithm. Here are some potential improvements:

1. Use a more efficient data structure to represent the tiles and their edges, such as a map or a custom struct.
2. Implement a faster method for matching tile edges, possibly using string hashing or bit manipulation.
3. Use a backtracking algorithm to assemble the image more efficiently.
4. Optimize the sea monster detection by pre-computing the monster pattern and using sliding window technique.

I'll implement these optimizations in the revised solution, focusing on efficient data structures and algorithms to speed up the process.
