The error message indicates that the `erosion_level` function is missing a required positional argument 'cache'. This suggests that the function definition for `erosion_level` has been updated to include a cache parameter, but not all calls to this function have been updated accordingly. To fix this, we need to ensure that all calls to `erosion_level` include the cache parameter.

Additionally, it seems that the `geologic_index` function is also calling `erosion_level`, which might create a circular dependency. We should restructure the code to avoid this circular dependency by calculating the erosion level after the geologic index has been determined.
