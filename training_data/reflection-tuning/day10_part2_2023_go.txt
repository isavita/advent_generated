To solve this problem, we need to approach it in two parts:

1. Find the loop and its length (Part 1)
2. Calculate the area enclosed by the loop (Part 2)

For Part 1:
- We'll use a depth-first search (DFS) to find the loop starting from 'S'.
- We'll keep track of the distance from 'S' for each pipe in the loop.
- The farthest point will be the maximum distance we find.

For Part 2:
- We'll use the "ray casting" algorithm to determine which points are inside the loop.
- We'll scan each row from left to right, keeping track of whether we're inside or outside the loop.
- We'll count the number of times we cross a vertical pipe (|, J, L) to determine if we're inside or outside.
- We need to be careful with corners (F-J and L-7 count as crossing, F-7 and L-J don't).

We'll implement both parts in a single pass through the grid for efficiency.
