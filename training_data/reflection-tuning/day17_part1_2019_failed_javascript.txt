The error message indicates that we're trying to call the 'map' function on 'output', which is undefined. This suggests that the 'parseScaffoldView' function is not receiving the expected input, or the input is not being processed correctly before this line. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. The Intcode computer is correctly implemented and running the ASCII program.
2. The output from the Intcode computer is being passed correctly to the 'parseScaffoldView' function.
3. We handle the case where the output might be undefined or empty.

I'll modify the code to address these issues, assuming that the Intcode computer is correctly implemented elsewhere in the code.
