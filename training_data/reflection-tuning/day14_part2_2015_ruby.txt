To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract reindeer data.
2. Implement a function to calculate the distance traveled by each reindeer after 2503 seconds.
3. Implement a function to simulate the race second by second, awarding points to the leading reindeer(s).
4. Keep track of the maximum distance traveled (for Part 1) and the maximum points earned (for Part 2).

We'll use a Reindeer class to encapsulate each reindeer's properties and behavior. We'll then create an array of Reindeer objects and iterate through them for both parts of the problem.

For Part 1, we'll calculate the total distance traveled by each reindeer after 2503 seconds and find the maximum.

For Part 2, we'll simulate the race second by second, updating distances and awarding points. We'll keep a running tally of points for each reindeer and find the maximum at the end.
