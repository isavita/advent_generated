Based on the given output, it seems that the previous solution was partially correct, as it produced answers for both Part 1 and Part 2. However, the answer for Part 1 (1286) is incorrect, while the answer for Part 2 (14773357352059) is correct.

The main issue likely lies in the implementation of the mixing process for Part 1. Some possible reasons for the incorrect result could be:

1. Incorrect handling of negative numbers during the mixing process.
2. Issues with the circular nature of the list, possibly not wrapping around correctly.
3. Miscalculation when finding the 1000th, 2000th, and 3000th numbers after 0.

To fix this, we should carefully review and revise the mixing process implementation, ensuring that we handle negative numbers correctly, properly wrap around the list, and accurately calculate the grove coordinates.

For Part 2, since the result is correct, we can keep that implementation as is, but we'll need to make sure our fixes for Part 1 don't break Part 2.
