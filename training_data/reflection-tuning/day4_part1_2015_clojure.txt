To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the secret key from the input file.
2. Implement a function to generate MD5 hashes.
3. Iterate through numbers, starting from 1, until we find a hash that starts with at least five zeroes.
4. Use efficient string manipulation and comparison to check the hash prefix.
5. Optimize the solution by using lazy sequences and early termination.

The key to efficiency here is to use Clojure's built-in functions for MD5 hashing and to avoid unnecessary string conversions. We'll use java.security.MessageDigest for MD5 hashing and java.math.BigInteger for converting byte arrays to hexadecimal strings.
