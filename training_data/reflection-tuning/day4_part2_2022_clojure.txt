To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse each line into pairs of ranges.
2. For each pair, we'll check for both full containment and any overlap.
3. We'll use Clojure's built-in functions to streamline the process.
4. To check for containment, we'll compare the start and end of each range.
5. To check for overlap, we'll see if the end of one range is greater than or equal to the start of the other range, and vice versa.
6. We'll use reduce to count the number of pairs that satisfy each condition.
7. Finally, we'll print both results (for Part One and Part Two).
