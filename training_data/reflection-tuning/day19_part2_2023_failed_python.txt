To solve this problem efficiently, we need to approach it with a range-based solution rather than checking individual combinations. Here's the thought process:

1. Parse the workflows into a dictionary for easy access.
2. Create a function to process ranges through the workflows.
3. Start with the full range (1-4000) for each rating (x, m, a, s).
4. For each workflow rule:
   - If it's an acceptance (A), add the current ranges to the accepted count.
   - If it's a rejection (R), discard the current ranges.
   - If it's a comparison, split the range and continue processing both parts.
5. Use a depth-first search approach to follow all possible paths through the workflows.
6. Keep track of the total number of accepted combinations.

This approach allows us to process large ranges of values at once, significantly reducing the computation time compared to checking each individual combination.
