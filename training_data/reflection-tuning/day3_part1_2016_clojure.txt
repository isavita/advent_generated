To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file line by line
2. Parse each line into three numbers representing the sides of a triangle
3. Check if the triangle is valid using the condition: sum of any two sides must be larger than the remaining side
4. Count the number of valid triangles
5. Print the final count

We can use Clojure's file reading capabilities, string manipulation, and higher-order functions to create a concise and efficient solution.
