Based on the incorrect output of 24199, it seems the previous solution might have miscalculated the final number of units in the winning army. The error could be due to:

1. Incorrect implementation of the combat mechanics, such as not properly handling immunities and weaknesses.
2. Prematurely ending the simulation before one army is completely defeated.
3. Not correctly summing up the units of the winning army at the end.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. The combat mechanics are correctly implemented, including proper handling of immunities and weaknesses.
2. The simulation continues until one army has no units left.
3. We correctly sum up the remaining units of the winning army at the end.

I'll provide a revised solution that addresses these potential issues.
