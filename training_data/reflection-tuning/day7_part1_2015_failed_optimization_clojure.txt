The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to redundant calculations or an ineffective approach to handling wire dependencies. To address this, we should implement a memoization strategy or a dynamic programming approach. This would involve caching the results of wire calculations to avoid recomputing values for wires that have already been resolved. Additionally, we should ensure that we're resolving wires in a way that minimizes redundant calculations, possibly by using a topological sort or a recursive approach with memoization.
