The error message suggests that there's an attempt to cast a Character to a Map.Entry, which is not possible. This likely occurs in the process-instructions function. The error is probably due to trying to use a character directly as a key-value pair in a map operation. To fix this, we need to ensure that we're properly handling characters and not treating them as map entries. We should modify the process-instructions function to correctly process each character without attempting to use it as a map entry.
