To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to extract the enhancement rules.
2. Implement functions to flip and rotate patterns for matching rules.
3. Create a function to enhance the grid based on the rules.
4. Iterate the enhancement process 5 times.
5. Count the number of '#' pixels in the final grid.

The key challenges are:
- Efficiently storing and matching rules
- Handling the grid divisions and transformations
- Optimizing for performance, especially for larger grids

We'll use a Map to store rules for quick lookup, and implement helper functions for pattern matching and grid manipulation. The main loop will handle the iterations and grid size changes.
