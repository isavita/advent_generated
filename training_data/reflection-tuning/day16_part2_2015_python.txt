To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract information about each Aunt Sue.
2. Define the MFCSAM readings.
3. For Part 1, compare each Aunt Sue's attributes with the MFCSAM readings, finding the one that matches all known attributes.
4. For Part 2, modify the comparison logic to account for the "greater than" and "fewer than" conditions for specific attributes.
5. Implement a function to check if an Aunt Sue matches the criteria for both parts.
6. Iterate through all Aunts Sue and find the matching ones for both parts.

The solution will use dictionaries to store Aunt Sue data and MFCSAM readings, making comparisons efficient. We'll use a single pass through the data to solve both parts simultaneously.
