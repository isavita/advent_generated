To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to create a map of reactions.
2. Implement a recursive function to calculate the required ORE for a given chemical and quantity.
3. Use a memoization technique to optimize the calculation for repeated chemicals.
4. Start the calculation from 1 FUEL and recursively calculate the required ORE.

The key points in the implementation are:
- Using a hash to store the reactions for quick lookup.
- Implementing a depth-first search to calculate the required materials.
- Using a hash to store excess materials to minimize waste.
- Rounding up the required quantity to the nearest multiple of the reaction output.
