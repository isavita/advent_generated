The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using an inefficient algorithm, possibly a brute-force approach or a poorly optimized search algorithm. To fix this, we need to implement a more efficient solution. 

For this type of problem, a good approach would be to use a breadth-first search (BFS) with some optimizations:

1. Use a bitset to represent the collected keys, which allows for faster operations and less memory usage.
2. Implement a state-based BFS where each state includes the current position(s), collected keys, and steps taken.
3. Use memoization to avoid revisiting states we've already explored.
4. Precompute distances between keys and entrances to avoid redundant path finding.
5. For part 2, treat each quadrant separately and combine the results.

This approach should significantly reduce the computation time and avoid timeout issues.
