The error message indicates that the module '@datastructures-js/priority-queue' cannot be found. This suggests that the previous solution was trying to use an external library for a priority queue, which is not available in the current environment. To fix this, we need to implement our own priority queue or use a different approach that doesn't rely on external libraries.

For this problem, we can implement a simple solution using a depth-first search (DFS) with memoization. We'll represent the burrow state as a string and use a map to store the minimum energy required for each state. This approach should work without any external dependencies.
