Based on the error message "507", it seems the previous solution might have calculated an incorrect number of steps to reach ZZ from AA. This could be due to several reasons:

1. Incorrect handling of portals: The solution might not have properly implemented the teleportation between portal pairs.
2. Inefficient pathfinding: The algorithm used might not have found the shortest path through the maze.
3. Misinterpretation of the maze structure: The solution might have misunderstood how the donut-shaped maze wraps around.

To fix this, we should implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm that correctly handles the portal teleportation. We'll need to:

1. Parse the input to create a map of the maze and identify portals.
2. Implement a BFS that considers both normal movement and portal teleportation.
3. Ensure we're finding the shortest path from AA to ZZ.

Let's implement a solution that addresses these points.
