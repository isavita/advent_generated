The error message indicates that the number of points affected by the tractor beam is 0, which is clearly incorrect. This suggests that there might be an issue with how we're running the Intcode program or interpreting its output. The most likely problems could be:

1. The Intcode program might not be properly initialized or run for each point.
2. We might not be correctly interpreting the output of the Intcode program.
3. The loop that scans the 50x50 area might be incorrect.

To fix this, we should ensure that:
1. We're properly initializing and running the Intcode program for each point.
2. We're correctly interpreting the output (1 for affected, 0 for not affected).
3. We're scanning the correct 50x50 area (0 through 49 for both X and Y).
4. We're properly counting the affected points.

Let's revise the code with these considerations in mind.
