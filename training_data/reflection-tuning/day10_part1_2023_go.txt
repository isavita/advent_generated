To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" and create a 2D grid of the pipe maze.
2. Find the starting position 'S' in the grid.
3. Determine the type of pipe at the starting position by checking its connections.
4. Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from the starting position to find the longest path.
5. Keep track of the maximum distance reached during the BFS.
6. Return the maximum distance as the answer.

We'll use a struct to represent each position in the grid, storing its coordinates and distance from the start. We'll also use a queue for the BFS implementation.
