The previous solution likely had an issue with the implementation of the circular buffer or the insertion logic. The output of 1447 suggests that the algorithm might have been close, but not quite correct. The problem likely lies in how the current position is updated after each insertion or how the circular buffer is managed.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. The circular buffer is correctly implemented, possibly using an array.
2. The current position is properly updated after each step and insertion.
3. The insertion logic correctly places new values after the current position.
4. The loop runs for exactly 2017 iterations.
5. We correctly identify the value that comes after 2017 in the final buffer.

I'll implement a solution that carefully follows the problem description, using an array to represent the circular buffer and modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the buffer.
