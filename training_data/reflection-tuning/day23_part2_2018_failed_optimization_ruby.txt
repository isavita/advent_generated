The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to a brute-force approach or unnecessary iterations. For Part Two of this problem, a more optimized approach is needed. Instead of checking every possible coordinate, we can use a divide-and-conquer strategy or a more intelligent search method.

One efficient approach could be to use a 3D binary search or octree-like structure to narrow down the search space. We can start with a large cube that encompasses all nanobots, then recursively divide it into smaller cubes, focusing on areas with the highest concentration of nanobots in range.

Another optimization could be to use the fact that the optimal point is likely to be at the intersection of the boundaries of multiple nanobot ranges. We can find these intersection points and check their neighborhoods.

Lastly, we can implement early termination conditions and pruning to avoid unnecessary calculations.
