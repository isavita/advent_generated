The error message indicates that there's an undefined local variable or method `boss_hp`. This suggests that the `boss_hp` variable is not properly defined or passed into the `find_min_gold` method. To fix this, we need to ensure that `boss_hp` is properly defined and passed as a parameter to the `find_min_gold` method. Additionally, we should make sure that all other necessary variables (like `boss_damage` and `boss_armor`) are also properly defined and passed.
