To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input to create a list of foods with their ingredients and allergens.
2. Create a mapping of allergens to possible ingredients.
3. Identify ingredients that can't contain allergens.
4. Count occurrences of these safe ingredients (Part 1).
5. Determine which ingredient contains which allergen (Part 2).
6. Sort the dangerous ingredients by allergen and create the final list.

We'll use Sets and Maps for efficient lookups and to avoid duplicates. We'll iterate through the data multiple times to narrow down the allergen-ingredient pairs.
