To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider a few key points:

1. We need to represent the programs as a string for easy manipulation.
2. We should implement the dance moves (spin, exchange, partner) as separate methods.
3. For Part Two, performing the dance a billion times would be too slow. We need to find a pattern or cycle in the dance sequence.
4. Once we find the cycle length, we can calculate the final state after a billion dances without actually performing them all.

The approach will be:
1. Implement the dance moves.
2. Perform the dance once for Part One.
3. For Part Two, keep performing the dance until we find a repeated state.
4. Calculate how many dances are equivalent to a billion dances using modular arithmetic.
5. Perform the dance that many times to get the final state.

This approach will be much more efficient than actually performing a billion dances.
