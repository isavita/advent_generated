The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to unnecessary iterations or complex data structures. To address this, we should focus on optimizing the algorithm to traverse the diagram more efficiently. A key improvement would be to use a single pass through the diagram, updating our position and direction as we go, without needing to store the entire diagram in memory. We can also keep track of the steps taken and the letters encountered simultaneously, eliminating the need for multiple passes through the data.
