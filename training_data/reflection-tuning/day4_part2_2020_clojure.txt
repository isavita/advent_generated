To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we'll follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse it into a sequence of passport maps.
2. Define functions to validate each field according to the given rules.
3. Create a function to check if a passport is valid (all required fields present and valid).
4. Count the number of valid passports.

We'll use Clojure's built-in functions for string manipulation and regular expressions for efficient validation. We'll also use the threading macro (->) to make the code more readable.
