The error message indicates that the symbol 'combinations' is not resolved in the context. This suggests that the previous solution might have been trying to use a function or library for combinations that wasn't properly imported or defined. For this problem, we don't actually need combinations. Instead, we need to calculate the surface area of each box and the area of its smallest side. We can do this by parsing each line of input, calculating the required paper for each box, and summing the results. Let's write a solution that focuses on these calculations without relying on any external combination functions.
