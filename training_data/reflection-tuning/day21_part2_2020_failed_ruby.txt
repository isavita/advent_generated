The error message indicates that there's an issue with the `&` operation between `ingredients` and `safe_ingredients`. It seems that `safe_ingredients` is a Set, while the `&` operation is expecting an Array. To fix this, we need to convert `safe_ingredients` to an Array before performing the intersection operation. Additionally, we should ensure that we're using the correct data structures throughout the code.

Another potential issue could be in how we're parsing the input and storing the data. We should make sure that `foods` is properly structured as an array of arrays, where each inner array contains the ingredients list and the allergens list.

To address these issues, we'll modify the code to:
1. Convert `safe_ingredients` to an Array when performing the intersection.
2. Ensure proper parsing of the input data.
3. Use appropriate data structures (Arrays and Sets) consistently.
