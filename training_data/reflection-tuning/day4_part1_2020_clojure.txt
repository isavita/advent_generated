To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file and parse it into individual passports.
2. Define a set of required fields.
3. For each passport, check if it contains all required fields.
4. Count the number of valid passports.

The approach will be:
- Use `slurp` to read the file contents.
- Split the content by double newlines to separate passports.
- For each passport, split by whitespace and create a map of key-value pairs.
- Define a set of required fields (excluding 'cid').
- Use `every?` to check if all required fields are present in each passport.
- Count the number of valid passports using `count` and `filter`.
