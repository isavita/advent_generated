The previous solution likely had an issue with parsing the input correctly or implementing the rule-matching logic. The output of 0 suggests that either no messages were being counted as matching rule 0, or the parsing of the input failed entirely. To fix this, we need to ensure that:

1. The input is correctly split into rules and messages.
2. The rules are parsed and stored in a suitable data structure (e.g., a dictionary).
3. A recursive function is implemented to match messages against rules.
4. The matching function correctly handles both literal characters and references to other rules.
5. The main loop correctly counts the number of messages that fully match rule 0.

I'll implement a solution that addresses these points, using a recursive approach to match messages against the rules.
