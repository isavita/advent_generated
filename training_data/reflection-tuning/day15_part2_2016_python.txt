To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract information about each disc.
2. Implement a function to check if a capsule will pass through all discs at a given time.
3. Iterate through possible start times until we find one that allows the capsule to pass.
4. For Part Two, add the new disc and repeat the process.

The key insight is that we can use modular arithmetic to determine the position of each disc at any given time. We'll use a loop to check increasing start times until we find a solution.
