The previous solution likely failed because it didn't account for the infinite nature of the map and the extremely large number of steps (26501365). The output 630128127261059 seems too large and doesn't match the pattern described in the problem.

To solve this, we need to recognize that there's a pattern in how the plots are filled. Given the large number of steps and the repeating nature of the map, we can expect the solution to involve some mathematical pattern rather than a direct simulation.

Key observations:
1. The number of steps (26501365) is odd, meaning we'll end up on the opposite parity of tiles from where we started.
2. The input grid is likely square (let's assume 131x131 based on common puzzle inputs).
3. 26501365 = 202300 * 131 + 65, which means we'll go exactly 202300 full grid widths plus 65 steps.

We can break this down into:
- A diamond shape of fully filled grids
- Partially filled grids at the edges
- Corner cases

We'll need to calculate:
1. The number of full odd and even grids
2. The number of plots reachable in a single grid for both odd and even steps
3. Special cases for the edges and corners

This approach should give us a much more accurate and efficient solution for the large number of steps.
