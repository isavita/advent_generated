To solve this problem, we need to simulate a network of 50 Intcode computers. Here's the approach:

1. Implement an Intcode computer class that can run the given program.
2. Create a Network class to manage the 50 computers and their packet queues.
3. Initialize all 50 computers with unique addresses from 0 to 49.
4. Run the network simulation until a packet is sent to address 255.
5. Keep track of the Y value of the first packet sent to address 255.

The main challenge is to efficiently manage the packet queues and handle the input/output operations for each computer. We'll use a queue data structure for each computer's packet queue and implement a custom input/output handler for the Intcode computers to interact with the network.
