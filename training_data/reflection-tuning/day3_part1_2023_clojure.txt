To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file and parse it into a 2D array or vector of characters.
2. Iterate through each character in the schematic.
3. When we find a number, we need to check its surroundings (including diagonals) for symbols.
4. If a symbol is found adjacent to the number, we add it to our sum.
5. We need to be careful to handle multi-digit numbers correctly.

An efficient approach would be to:
- Use a single pass through the schematic.
- Keep track of the current number we're building and whether it's adjacent to a symbol.
- Use helper functions to check for symbols and to process complete numbers.
