The error messages indicate several syntax issues in the Ruby code:

1. Unexpected '=' in multiple lines, suggesting incorrect multiple assignment syntax.
2. Attempt to assign to 'false', which is not allowed in Ruby.
3. Unexpected '\n', indicating an incomplete statement.

To fix these issues, we need to:
1. Correct the multiple assignment syntax by using parentheses.
2. Replace the 'false, [0, 0]' line with a proper return statement.
3. Ensure all statements are complete and properly formatted.

Additionally, the code seems to be incomplete, missing the main logic for addition and magnitude calculation. We'll need to implement these features to solve the problem correctly.
