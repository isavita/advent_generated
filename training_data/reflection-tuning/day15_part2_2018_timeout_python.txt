The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to excessive iterations or a suboptimal algorithm. To address this, we should focus on optimizing the combat simulation and pathfinding algorithms. Here are some potential improvements:

1. Use a more efficient pathfinding algorithm, such as A* instead of a simple breadth-first search.
2. Implement caching for pathfinding results to avoid recalculating paths unnecessarily.
3. Optimize the unit movement and attack logic to reduce unnecessary iterations.
4. Use a priority queue for managing unit turns to avoid sorting units repeatedly.
5. Implement early termination conditions to exit the simulation as soon as a winner is determined.

With these optimizations in mind, let's rewrite the solution to be more efficient.
