Based on the output provided, it seems that Part 1 was solved correctly (result: 5948), but Part 2 is returning 0, which is likely incorrect. The main issue appears to be in the implementation of Part 2, where the vacuum robot needs to visit every part of the scaffold.

The problem likely lies in:
1. Not properly setting the first memory address to 2 to wake up the vacuum robot.
2. Not correctly implementing the movement logic and input handling for the robot.
3. Possibly not parsing the final large, non-ASCII output value correctly.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Ensure we set memory[0] = 2 at the start of Part 2.
2. Implement a function to compress the full path into main routine and functions A, B, and C.
3. Properly handle the input/output for the robot's movement instructions.
4. Correctly parse the final output to get the dust collection amount.
