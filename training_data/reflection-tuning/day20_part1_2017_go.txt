To solve this problem, we need to consider the long-term behavior of the particles. The key insight is that the acceleration determines the long-term trajectory of each particle. Particles with the smallest acceleration magnitude will eventually be closest to the origin.

Here's the approach:
1. Parse the input file to extract particle information.
2. For each particle, calculate the Manhattan distance of its acceleration vector.
3. Find the particle with the smallest acceleration magnitude.
4. If multiple particles have the same smallest acceleration, compare their velocity magnitudes.
5. If velocities are also the same, compare their initial positions.
6. Return the index of the particle that will stay closest to <0,0,0> in the long term.

This approach is efficient because it doesn't require simulating the particles over time. Instead, it uses the acceleration as the primary factor, which determines the long-term behavior.
