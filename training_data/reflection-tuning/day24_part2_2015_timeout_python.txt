The error message "584557328155710" suggests that the previous solution might have calculated the quantum entanglement correctly but failed to find the optimal configuration. The issue could be in the logic for finding the smallest group with the lowest quantum entanglement. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. We're considering all possible combinations of packages for the first group.
2. We're correctly identifying the smallest possible group size.
3. Among the smallest groups, we're selecting the one with the lowest quantum entanglement.
4. We're properly handling the case of four groups instead of three.

The solution should involve:
- Generating all possible combinations of packages for the first group.
- Filtering these combinations to only those that allow equal distribution among all four groups.
- Finding the smallest valid group size.
- Among the smallest groups, finding the one with the lowest quantum entanglement.

Let's implement this approach:
