The previous solution likely had an issue with correctly implementing the tractor beam logic or counting the affected points. The output of 0 suggests that the code wasn't properly detecting any points affected by the tractor beam, which is incorrect. To fix this, we need to ensure that:

1. We're correctly implementing the Intcode program to check each coordinate.
2. We're properly counting the points that are affected (where the output is 1).
3. We're scanning the entire 50x50 area as requested.

The solution should involve creating an Intcode computer, running it for each coordinate in the 50x50 grid, and counting the points where the output is 1.
