To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) with memoization. Here's the approach:

1. Parse the input to create a graph representation of the valve network.
2. Create a bitmask to represent opened valves.
3. Implement a DFS function that explores all possible paths, keeping track of:
   - Current valve
   - Time remaining
   - Pressure released so far
   - Opened valves (using the bitmask)
4. Use memoization to avoid recalculating the same states.
5. At each step, we have two choices:
   - Open the current valve (if it's not already open and has a non-zero flow rate)
   - Move to a connected valve
6. Return the maximum pressure that can be released in 30 minutes.

This approach will efficiently explore all possibilities while avoiding redundant calculations.
