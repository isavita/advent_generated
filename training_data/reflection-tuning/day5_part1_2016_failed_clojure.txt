The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, probably due to a brute-force approach that checks every possible index sequentially. To optimize this, we can:

1. Use a more efficient MD5 hashing library if available.
2. Implement a parallel processing approach to check multiple indices simultaneously.
3. Use lazy sequences to generate and test hashes on-demand rather than all at once.
4. Optimize the string comparison for the five leading zeros.

I'll implement a solution using lazy sequences and a more efficient comparison method. This should significantly reduce the execution time while still solving the problem correctly.
