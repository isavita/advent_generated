The previous solution seems to have produced incorrect results for both Part 1 and Part 2. The values 6 and 13 are far too low for the complexity of the problem described. The issue likely lies in the implementation of the instruction execution and the halting condition check.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Ensure all instructions (especially bitwise operations) are correctly implemented.
2. Implement a proper halting condition check.
3. For Part 1, we need to find the lowest non-negative integer for register 0 that causes the program to halt after the fewest instructions.
4. For Part 2, we need to find the lowest non-negative integer for register 0 that causes the program to halt after the most instructions.

We'll need to simulate the program execution for different initial values of register 0, keeping track of the number of instructions executed. We'll use a large upper bound for Part 2 to ensure we don't miss the correct answer.
