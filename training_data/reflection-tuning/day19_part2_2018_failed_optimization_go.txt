The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to a brute-force approach or an infinite loop. For this type of problem involving instruction execution and register manipulation, the key is to simulate the program efficiently.

To improve performance, we should:

1. Use a map to store the opcode functions, allowing for quick lookup and execution.
2. Implement the instruction pointer binding mechanism correctly.
3. Avoid unnecessary loops or iterations.
4. Optimize the execution of instructions, especially for Part Two where register 0 starts with 1, which might lead to a much longer execution time.

For Part Two, we might need to analyze the input program to find a pattern or optimization opportunity, rather than simply executing all instructions, as it might take too long to reach the halting condition.
