Based on the incorrect output provided, it seems that the solution for Part One is correct (cbeghdaf), but the solution for Part Two is incorrect (dhacefbg). The main issue appears to be in the reverse engineering process for Part Two.

To fix this, we need to focus on reversing each operation in the opposite order they were applied. Some operations, like swapping positions or letters, are their own inverse. However, others, like rotations and moves, need special handling:

1. For rotations, we need to rotate in the opposite direction.
2. For "rotate based on position of letter X", we need to implement a reverse lookup to determine how many rotations to undo.
3. For move operations, we need to reverse the source and destination.

The most challenging part is likely the "rotate based on position" operation, as it's not a simple inverse. We might need to create a lookup table or use trial-and-error to determine the correct reverse rotation.

Let's implement these changes in our revised solution.
