To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Read the input key string from the file.
2. Generate 128 knot hashes, one for each row.
3. Convert each knot hash to binary.
4. Count the number of '1' bits in all 128 rows combined.

For the knot hash calculation, we'll need to implement the algorithm from Day 10. We'll create a separate method for this.

To optimize the solution, we can:
- Use bitwise operations to convert hexadecimal to binary.
- Count '1' bits directly in the hexadecimal representation instead of converting to binary first.
