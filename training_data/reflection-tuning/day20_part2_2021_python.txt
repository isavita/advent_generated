To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Read the image enhancement algorithm and the initial image from the input file.
2. Implement a function to enhance the image, considering the infinite nature of the image.
3. Handle the edge cases where the infinite background might flip between light and dark.
4. Enhance the image the required number of times (2 for Part 1, 50 for Part 2).
5. Count the number of lit pixels in the final image.

Key optimizations:
- Use a set to store only the lit pixels, as the image is infinite.
- Expand the boundaries of the image only as needed during each enhancement.
- Use a flag to track whether the infinite background is lit or dark.
