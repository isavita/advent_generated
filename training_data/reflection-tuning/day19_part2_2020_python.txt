The error message indicates a KeyError when trying to access a rule with the key '43 106'. This suggests that the input parsing might be incorrect, leading to a rule number being interpreted as two separate numbers. The issue likely occurs in the generate_regex function where it's trying to recursively process rules.

To fix this, we need to ensure that rule numbers are properly parsed as single integers, and that the recursive calls in generate_regex are handling the rule numbers correctly. We should also add some error checking to handle cases where a rule might not exist in the rules dictionary.

Additionally, the part2 logic for handling the looping rules 8 and 11 needs to be implemented correctly to avoid infinite recursion.
