The error in the previous solution seems to be related to the expansion factor. The first part of the problem uses an expansion factor of 2, while the second part uses an expansion factor of 1,000,000. The incorrect output suggests that the expansion factor might not have been properly applied or was set incorrectly.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that:
1. We're using the correct expansion factor for each part of the problem.
2. The expansion factor is applied correctly when calculating distances between galaxies.
3. We're handling the expansion of empty rows and columns properly.

I'll revise the solution to address these points, making sure to use the correct expansion factors and apply them accurately in the distance calculations.
