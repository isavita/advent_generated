The error message indicates an index out of range panic, specifically for index 11 with a length of 10. This suggests that we're trying to access an array element that doesn't exist. The issue is likely occurring in the recursive calls of the countArrangements function.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we're not accessing indices beyond the length of our arrays. We should add boundary checks before accessing array elements, especially in recursive calls. Additionally, we should review our base cases and ensure they're correctly handling all scenarios, including when we reach the end of the string or groups.

Another potential issue could be in how we're handling the '?' characters. We need to make sure we're correctly exploring both possibilities (operational and damaged) for these unknown springs.
