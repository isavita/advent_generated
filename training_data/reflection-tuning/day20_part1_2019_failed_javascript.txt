The error message indicates that 'start' is not iterable. This suggests that 'start' is likely not defined as an array or another iterable object as expected. In the maze problem, 'start' should typically be the coordinates of the starting position (AA). To fix this, we need to ensure that 'start' is properly defined as an array of coordinates before using it in the spread operator.

Additionally, the problem description suggests we need to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path through the maze, taking into account the portal teleportations. We should also parse the input to identify the start (AA), end (ZZ), and portal positions.
