To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Read the starting values for generators A and B from the input file.
2. Implement the generation logic for both generators.
3. Compare the lowest 16 bits of each generated pair.
4. Count the matches over 40 million iterations.

To optimize the solution:
- We'll use bitwise operations to compare the lowest 16 bits.
- We'll implement the generation logic inline to avoid function call overhead.
- We'll use a single loop for both generators to reduce code complexity.

The key is to efficiently generate the next value and perform the comparison without unnecessary conversions or operations.
