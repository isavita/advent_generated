The error message shows "0" as the output, which suggests that the previous solution might not have correctly implemented the logic to find the three wires to disconnect and calculate the product of the resulting group sizes. The issue could be in the graph representation, the algorithm to find the optimal wires to disconnect, or in the calculation of the group sizes.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Properly parse the input and create a graph representation.
2. Implement a method to find all connections (edges) in the graph.
3. Use an algorithm (like itertools.combinations) to try disconnecting different combinations of three wires.
4. For each combination, check if it results in two disconnected groups.
5. Calculate the sizes of the two groups and their product.
6. Keep track of the maximum product found.

I'll implement a solution using a depth-first search (DFS) to check connectivity and find group sizes.
