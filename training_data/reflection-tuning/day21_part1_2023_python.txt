To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. Here's the thought process:

1. Read the input map from the file.
2. Find the starting position 'S'.
3. Implement a BFS algorithm that:
   - Starts from 'S' and explores in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
   - Keeps track of the step count and the positions reached at each step.
   - Stops when we reach 64 steps.
4. Count the number of unique positions reached at exactly 64 steps.

We'll use a set to keep track of visited positions at each step to avoid revisiting the same position in the same number of steps. We'll also use a queue to manage the BFS traversal.

This approach is efficient because:
- It explores all possible paths simultaneously.
- It avoids redundant calculations by not revisiting positions in the same number of steps.
- It stops exactly at 64 steps, not exploring further unnecessarily.
