To solve this problem efficiently, we need to analyze the input code and understand what it's doing. Instead of simulating the entire program, which would be very slow, we can deduce the mathematical operation it's performing.

Upon analysis, we can see that the program is essentially checking if a number (b * 100 + 100000) is prime, and if not, incrementing h. It does this for 1001 consecutive numbers.

Instead of running the inefficient assembly-like code, we can implement a more efficient primality check in Ruby and count the number of composite numbers in the range.

The key optimizations are:
1. Use a more efficient primality test
2. Avoid unnecessary iterations by checking only odd numbers (except 2)
3. Use square root as the upper limit for primality check

This approach will be significantly faster than simulating the original code.
