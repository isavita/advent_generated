The error message indicates that there's an issue with the constructor of the IntcodeComputer class. It's being called with an argument (input), but the class is defined without any parameters in its initialize method. To fix this, we need to modify the IntcodeComputer class to accept an input parameter in its constructor.

Additionally, we should ensure that the input is properly processed and stored within the IntcodeComputer instance. We'll need to implement the logic for running the Intcode program, handling the ASCII output, and calculating the alignment parameters.

For Part Two, we'll need to modify the program to wake up the vacuum robot and implement the movement logic. This will involve changing the first memory address from 1 to 2 and providing movement instructions as ASCII input.
