To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider the following points:
1. We need to maintain the original order of numbers while mixing.
2. We need to handle circular movement efficiently.
3. For Part Two, we need to apply the decryption key and mix 10 times.

Approach:
1. Use a list of tuples (index, value) to maintain the original order.
2. Use modular arithmetic to handle circular movement efficiently.
3. Implement a mixing function that can be used for both parts.
4. For Part Two, multiply all values by the decryption key before mixing.
5. Find the position of 0 and calculate the grove coordinates.

The key to efficiency is to avoid actually moving elements in a list, which can be slow for large inputs. Instead, we'll use a linked list-like approach with a list of indices.
