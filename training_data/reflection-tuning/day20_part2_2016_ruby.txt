To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the following approach:

1. Read the input file and parse each line into a range of blocked IPs.
2. Sort these ranges based on their start values.
3. Merge overlapping ranges to simplify our blocked IP list.
4. For Part 1, find the first gap between ranges or the first available IP if there's a gap at the beginning.
5. For Part 2, calculate the total number of blocked IPs and subtract it from the total possible IPs (4294967296).

This approach allows us to handle large ranges of IPs efficiently without storing individual IP addresses.
