Based on the incorrect output provided, it seems the solution is close but not quite correct. The main issues could be:

1. The combat simulation might not be ending at the correct time, leading to an incorrect number of rounds.
2. The hit point calculation for the remaining units at the end of combat might be off.
3. There might be an issue with the movement or attack logic, causing units to behave incorrectly.

For Part 2, the algorithm to find the minimum attack power for Elves might not be efficient or might not be correctly identifying when all Elves survive.

To fix these issues, we should:
1. Double-check the combat end condition.
2. Verify the hit point calculation at the end of combat.
3. Review and possibly refactor the movement and attack logic.
4. Implement a more efficient binary search for finding the minimum Elf attack power in Part 2.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind.
