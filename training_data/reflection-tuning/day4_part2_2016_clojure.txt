To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse each line into room data (name, sector ID, checksum).
2. Implement a function to validate if a room is real based on the given criteria.
3. For Part One, sum the sector IDs of all real rooms.
4. For Part Two, implement a decryption function to rotate letters based on sector ID.
5. Decrypt all real room names and find the one mentioning "northpole" or similar.

We'll use Clojure's built-in functions for string manipulation, sorting, and filtering to keep the solution concise and efficient.
