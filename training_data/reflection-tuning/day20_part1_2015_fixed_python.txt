The previous solution likely calculated the number of presents for each house correctly but failed to find the lowest house number that meets the criteria. The error output "2882880" suggests that this might be the total number of presents for a specific house, but not the house number we're looking for.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Implement a more efficient way to calculate presents for each house.
2. Keep track of the lowest house number that meets or exceeds the target number of presents.
3. Use a loop that continues until we find the first house that meets the criteria.

We can use a sieve-like approach to efficiently calculate the presents for each house, similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm used for finding prime numbers. This will be more efficient than calculating presents for each house individually.
