The error message indicates that the "strings" package is imported but not used in the code. This suggests that the previous solution might have included the "strings" import unnecessarily. To fix this issue, we should remove the unused import statement for the "strings" package. Additionally, we need to ensure that all necessary imports are included and that the code logic is correct for solving the mirror pattern problem.

In the revised solution, we'll focus on implementing the logic to find reflection lines in the patterns and calculate the summary value. We'll use slices to store the patterns and implement functions to check for horizontal and vertical reflections. The main function will read the input, process each pattern, and calculate the total summary value.
