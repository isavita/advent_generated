Based on the error message, it seems that Part 1 was not solved at all, and Part 2 returned an incorrect answer of 1. This suggests that the previous solution might have had issues with:

1. Parsing the input correctly
2. Traversing the diagram properly
3. Counting steps accurately

To fix these issues, we need to:

1. Implement a proper input parsing function to create a 2D slice of runes
2. Create a function to traverse the diagram, following the rules given
3. Keep track of both the letters encountered (for Part 1) and the number of steps taken (for Part 2)
4. Handle all possible directions and turns correctly

I'll create a solution that addresses these points and solves both parts of the problem.
