The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to a brute-force approach or an infinite loop. For this type of problem involving a custom instruction set and register manipulation, the key to optimization is often to identify patterns or shortcuts in the execution flow.

Given that we're dealing with a custom instruction set and register manipulation, a more efficient approach would be to:

1. Implement the instruction set accurately.
2. Use a hash to store the opcodes and their corresponding operations for quick lookup.
3. Implement a function to execute the instructions that follows the rules precisely.
4. For Part Two, we need to analyze the program's behavior with register 0 starting at 1.

The main optimization would likely come from understanding the program's logic and finding a way to calculate the final result without simulating every single instruction, especially for Part Two where the initial value is different.
