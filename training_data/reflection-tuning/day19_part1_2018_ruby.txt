To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the instruction pointer binding and the list of instructions.
2. Implement the different opcodes (seti, setr, addi, addr, etc.).
3. Create a virtual machine that can execute these instructions.
4. Run the program until it halts (when the instruction pointer goes out of bounds).
5. Return the value in register 0 at the end of execution.

We'll create a class to represent our virtual machine, which will handle the execution of instructions and manage the registers. We'll use a hash to store the opcode implementations for easy execution.
