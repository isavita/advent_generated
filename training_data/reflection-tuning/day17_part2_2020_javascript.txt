To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Parse the initial state from the input file.
2. Implement a function to simulate the Conway Cube rules in 4D space.
3. Keep track of only the active cubes and their neighbors to optimize memory usage.
4. Use a Set to store active cube coordinates for quick lookup and unique storage.
5. Implement a function to get all neighbors of a given cube in 4D space.
6. Run the simulation for 6 cycles and count the active cubes at the end.

The key to efficiency is to only consider active cubes and their immediate neighbors in each cycle, rather than iterating over the entire infinite 4D space.
