The previous solution likely had an issue with the mana calculation or the spell effect management. The output of 787 suggests that the algorithm might have been finding a valid solution, but not necessarily the optimal (least amount of mana) solution. The problem might be in the search algorithm or the way we're tracking and applying spell effects.

To fix this, we should:
1. Implement a more efficient search algorithm, possibly using a priority queue to explore the least expensive paths first.
2. Ensure that we're correctly applying and removing spell effects at the right times.
3. Make sure we're considering all possible spell combinations and not prematurely cutting off potential winning paths.
4. Implement a proper state management system to keep track of player and boss stats, active effects, and mana spent.
5. Use a depth-first search with backtracking to explore all possibilities while keeping track of the minimum mana spent so far.

Let's implement a solution that addresses these potential issues:
