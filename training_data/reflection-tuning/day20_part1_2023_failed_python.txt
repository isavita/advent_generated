The previous solution likely had an issue with correctly simulating the pulse propagation or counting the pulses. The output 721809780 seems too low for the expected result, which should be in the millions or tens of millions based on the example outputs provided.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. We're correctly implementing all module types (broadcaster, flip-flop, conjunction).
2. We're properly simulating the pulse propagation through the network.
3. We're accurately counting both low and high pulses.
4. We're running the simulation for exactly 1000 button presses.
5. We're multiplying the total low pulses by the total high pulses at the end.

I'll rewrite the solution with these points in mind, making sure to implement a queue for pulse propagation and keeping track of the state of each module.
