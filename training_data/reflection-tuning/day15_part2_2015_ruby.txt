To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract ingredient properties.
2. Generate all possible combinations of ingredients that sum to 100 teaspoons.
3. Calculate the score for each combination.
4. Find the maximum score for Part 1.
5. For Part 2, add a calorie check and find the maximum score with exactly 500 calories.

We can use a recursive function to generate all combinations efficiently. To optimize, we can prune branches that exceed 100 teaspoons or 500 calories (for Part 2).
