Based on the incorrect output, it seems the previous solution might have had an issue with the termination condition or the way it was counting instructions. The Part 1 answer is very close to 1 million, which suggests it might have been off by one or had a boundary condition issue. For Part 2, the answer being exactly 1 million is suspicious and might indicate that the code didn't properly find the upper bound.

To fix this, we should:
1. Ensure our instruction execution is accurate.
2. Carefully check the halting condition.
3. For Part 1, make sure we're finding the true minimum value that causes halting.
4. For Part 2, implement a proper search for the maximum value, possibly using a binary search approach to find the upper bound efficiently.
5. Double-check our instruction set implementation, especially the bitwise operations.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind.
