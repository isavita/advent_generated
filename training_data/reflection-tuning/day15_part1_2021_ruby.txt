To solve this problem efficiently, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm is ideal for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph, which is essentially what our cave map represents. Each position in the cave is a node, and the risk levels are the weights of the edges connecting adjacent nodes.

Here's the approach:
1. Read the input file and create a 2D array representing the cave.
2. Implement a priority queue (using a simple array and sorting in this case) to always process the node with the lowest total risk first.
3. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the path with the lowest total risk:
   - Start from the top-left corner (0,0)
   - For each node, calculate the total risk to reach its neighbors
   - Update the neighbor's risk if a lower risk path is found
   - Continue until we reach the bottom-right corner
4. Return the total risk of the path to the bottom-right corner

This approach ensures we find the optimal path without having to explore all possible paths, making it efficient for larger inputs.
