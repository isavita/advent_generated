The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to excessive nested loops or an inefficient algorithm for comparing beacon positions across scanners. To address this, we can implement several optimizations:

1. Use a Set data structure to store unique beacon positions, which allows for faster lookups and eliminates duplicates.
2. Implement a more efficient algorithm for finding overlapping scanners, possibly using a hash-based approach to quickly identify potential matches.
3. Memoize or cache intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
4. Use vector operations for rotations and translations to reduce computation time.
5. Implement early termination conditions in loops where possible.

With these optimizations in mind, let's create a more efficient solution.
