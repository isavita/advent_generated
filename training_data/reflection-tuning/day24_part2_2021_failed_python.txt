The error message indicates that the `valid_numbers` list is empty when trying to find the maximum value. This suggests that the code is not successfully finding any valid model numbers. The issue could be in the logic for checking valid numbers or in the range of numbers being tested. To fix this, we should ensure that:

1. The range of numbers being tested is correct (14-digit numbers from 11111111111111 to 99999999999999).
2. The ALU simulation is correctly implemented.
3. The check for valid numbers (z == 0) is properly done.
4. We're correctly appending valid numbers to the `valid_numbers` list.

Additionally, we should add a check to ensure that `valid_numbers` is not empty before finding the maximum and minimum values. If it is empty, we should return an appropriate message.
