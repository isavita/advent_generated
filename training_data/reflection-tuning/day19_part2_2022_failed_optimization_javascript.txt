The main issue with the previous solution was likely the time complexity, causing it to timeout. To address this, we need to implement several optimizations:

1. Use a depth-first search (DFS) with pruning instead of a breadth-first search.
2. Implement memoization to avoid recalculating states we've already seen.
3. Add heuristics to prune branches that can't possibly lead to a better solution.
4. Limit the number of robots we build for each type based on the maximum resources needed per minute.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the search space and improve execution time.
