To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file and parse the instructions.
2. Implement a simple interpreter that can execute these instructions.
3. Keep track of the number of times the 'mul' instruction is invoked.
4. Use a hash to represent the registers for easy access and modification.
5. Implement a method for each instruction type (set, sub, mul, jnz).
6. Use a loop to execute instructions, updating the program counter accordingly.
7. Handle the 'jnz' instruction carefully to modify the program counter.
8. Return the count of 'mul' instructions executed.

This approach should provide an efficient solution as it directly simulates the program execution without unnecessary complexity.
