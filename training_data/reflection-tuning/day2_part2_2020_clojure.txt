To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we'll follow these steps:
1. Read the input file line by line.
2. Parse each line to extract the policy and password.
3. Implement two functions: one for Part 1 and another for Part 2 to validate passwords.
4. Count the number of valid passwords for each part.
5. Print the results.

We'll use Clojure's built-in functions like `slurp`, `line-seq`, `re-matches`, and `reduce` to efficiently process the input and calculate the results.
