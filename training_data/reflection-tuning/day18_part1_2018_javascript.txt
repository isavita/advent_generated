To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" and parse it into a 2D array.
2. Implement a function to count adjacent acres of each type.
3. Create a function to simulate one minute of changes.
4. Run the simulation for 10 minutes.
5. Count the final number of wooded acres and lumberyards.
6. Calculate and return the total resource value.

We'll use a 2D array to represent the lumber collection area. For efficiency, we'll create a new array for each minute rather than modifying the existing one, as all changes happen simultaneously. We'll also use constants for the acre types to improve readability.
