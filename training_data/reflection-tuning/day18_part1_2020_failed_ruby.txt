The previous solution seems to have produced an incorrect result (11143816). This suggests that the implementation might not be correctly handling the new operator precedence rules or the parentheses. The main issues to address are:

1. Ensuring that addition and multiplication have the same precedence.
2. Evaluating expressions from left to right.
3. Properly handling parentheses to override the default left-to-right evaluation.

To fix this, we need to implement a custom evaluation function that follows these rules. We should:

1. Parse the expression into tokens (numbers, operators, and parentheses).
2. Implement a function to evaluate expressions within parentheses recursively.
3. Evaluate the main expression from left to right, treating addition and multiplication with equal precedence.

Let's implement a solution that addresses these points.
