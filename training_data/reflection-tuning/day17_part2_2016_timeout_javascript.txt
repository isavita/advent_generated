The error message indicates that the module 'crypto-js' cannot be found. This suggests that the previous solution was trying to use the 'crypto-js' library, which is not a built-in Node.js module. To fix this issue, we need to implement our own MD5 hashing function or use a different approach that doesn't rely on external libraries.

Instead of using 'crypto-js', we can implement a simple MD5 hashing function ourselves. This will allow the code to run without any external dependencies. We'll also need to implement the logic for finding both the shortest and longest paths to the vault.

The approach will be:
1. Implement a basic MD5 hashing function.
2. Create a function to check if a door is open based on the hash.
3. Implement a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path.
4. Implement a depth-first search (DFS) to find the longest path.
5. Combine these functions to solve both parts of the puzzle.
