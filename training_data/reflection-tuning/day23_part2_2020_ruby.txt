To solve this problem efficiently, we need to use a data structure that allows for quick access and manipulation of elements. A linked list-like structure would be ideal, as we need to frequently remove and insert elements.

For Part 1, we can use an array where each index represents a cup label, and the value at that index points to the next cup in the circle. This allows for O(1) operations when moving cups.

For Part 2, we need to handle a much larger number of cups (1 million) and moves (10 million). The same approach as Part 1 will work, but we need to be careful with memory usage and optimize our operations.

The key steps in our solution will be:
1. Initialize the cups array
2. Implement the move operation efficiently
3. Run the simulation for the required number of moves
4. Extract the final arrangement (Part 1) or find the two cups after cup 1 (Part 2)

We'll create a single solution that can handle both parts of the problem by adjusting the number of cups and moves based on the part we're solving.
