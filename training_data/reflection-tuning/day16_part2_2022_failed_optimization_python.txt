The main issue with the previous solution was likely its time complexity, leading to a timeout. For this type of problem, a brute-force approach or inefficient search algorithm can easily exceed time limits. To address this, we need to implement a more efficient algorithm, possibly using dynamic programming or a optimized depth-first search with memoization.

Key optimizations to consider:
1. Use bitmasking to represent opened valves, which allows for faster state comparisons.
2. Implement memoization to avoid recalculating states we've already seen.
3. Prune paths that can't possibly lead to a better solution.
4. For part 2, instead of simulating both paths simultaneously, we can calculate the best path for a single actor and then find the best combination of two non-overlapping paths.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the execution time while still finding the optimal solution.
