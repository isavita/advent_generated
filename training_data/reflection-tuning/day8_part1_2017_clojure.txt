To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file and parse each line into a structured format.
2. Create a function to evaluate conditions.
3. Create a function to execute instructions.
4. Iterate through all instructions, updating registers as we go.
5. Find the maximum value in any register after processing all instructions.

We'll use a map to store register values, defaulting to 0 for any uninitialized register. We'll parse each instruction into a map for easy processing. The condition evaluation and instruction execution will be separate functions for clarity and reusability.
