To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Read and parse the input file to get the initial decks for both players.
2. Implement the game logic, which includes:
   - Playing rounds until one player has all the cards
   - For each round, compare the top cards and move them accordingly
3. After the game ends, calculate the score of the winning player
4. Print the final score

We'll use a queue-like structure (array with push and shift operations) to represent each player's deck. This will allow for efficient card drawing and adding to the bottom of the deck.
