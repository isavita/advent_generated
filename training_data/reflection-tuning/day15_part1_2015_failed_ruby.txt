The previous solution likely had an issue with calculating the total score correctly or finding the optimal combination of ingredients. The output of 0 suggests that either:

1. The calculation of properties resulted in negative values, causing the total score to become 0.
2. The algorithm didn't properly explore all possible combinations of ingredients.
3. There might have been an initialization problem where the best score was never updated.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. We properly handle negative property values by setting them to 0 before multiplication.
2. We explore all possible combinations of ingredients that sum up to 100 teaspoons.
3. We correctly calculate and update the best score.

I'll implement a solution using a recursive approach to generate all possible combinations, ensuring we cover all possibilities and calculate the score correctly.
