Based on the given output, it seems that Part 1 was solved correctly (619 nanobots in range of the strongest nanobot). However, the result for Part 2 (68206250) might be incorrect or not optimal.

The main issue with Part 2 is likely in the approach to finding the optimal position. The problem requires finding a point that is in range of the maximum number of nanobots, and if there are multiple such points, choosing the one closest to (0,0,0).

A common mistake in solving this type of problem is using a brute-force approach, which can be too slow or miss the optimal solution. Instead, we can use a more efficient method, such as:

1. Using a 3D grid to divide the space into smaller regions.
2. Implementing a binary search or octree to narrow down the search space.
3. Using z3 theorem prover to solve the constraint satisfaction problem.

For this solution, I'll implement a method using a 3D grid and gradually refining the search space. This approach should be more efficient and accurate than a simple brute-force method.
