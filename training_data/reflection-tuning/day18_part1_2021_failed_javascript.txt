The error message indicates that we're trying to access the 'indexOf' method on an undefined value at line 60 in the addLeft function. This suggests that we're trying to access an element of the 'path' array that doesn't exist. The issue likely occurs when we're traversing the snailfish number structure and trying to add a value to the left.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we're not accessing undefined elements in the path array. We should add a check to make sure that the previous element in the path exists before trying to use it. Additionally, we should handle the case where we can't find a place to add the left value (i.e., when we've reached the leftmost element of the snailfish number).
