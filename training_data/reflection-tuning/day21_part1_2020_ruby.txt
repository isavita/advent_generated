To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract ingredients and allergens for each food.
2. Create a mapping of allergens to possible ingredients.
3. Identify ingredients that can't possibly contain any allergens.
4. Count how many times these safe ingredients appear in the ingredient lists.

We'll use sets to efficiently handle ingredient lists and perform set operations. We'll also use a hash to map allergens to possible ingredients.
