To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract foods, their ingredients, and allergens.
2. Create a mapping of allergens to possible ingredients.
3. Identify ingredients that can't contain any allergens.
4. Count how many times these safe ingredients appear in all foods.

The approach will be:
1. Use a Map to store allergens and their possible ingredients.
2. Use a Set to store all unique ingredients.
3. Iterate through foods to update the allergen map and ingredient set.
4. Find ingredients that are not in any allergen's possible ingredient list.
5. Count occurrences of these safe ingredients in all foods.

This solution should be efficient as it uses Sets and Maps for quick lookups and avoids unnecessary nested loops.
