The error message indicates a ClassCastException where a Character is being cast to a CharSequence. This typically happens when we're trying to use a string operation on a single character. In the context of this problem, it's likely that we're trying to use a string function like 'contains?' or 'substring' on a single character instead of a string.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we're always working with strings or sequences when performing string operations. We might need to convert characters to strings or ensure that we're not accidentally treating a single character as a string.

Additionally, the error occurs in the 'supports-ssl?' function, so we should focus on revising that part of the code. We'll need to make sure we're correctly handling the ABA and BAB patterns, ensuring we're working with substrings of at least length 3 when checking for these patterns.
