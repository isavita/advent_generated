The error message suggests that the issue is occurring when trying to call the `slice()` and `join()` methods on a part of the grid. This implies that `grid[y + i]` might not be an array as expected, but possibly a string. To fix this, we need to ensure that the grid is always represented as an array of arrays (2D array) rather than an array of strings.

The error is likely occurring in the `enhance()` function, specifically when trying to extract a square from the grid. To address this, we should modify how we handle the grid data structure and how we extract squares from it.

Here's how we can approach fixing the issue:
1. Ensure the initial grid is an array of arrays, not an array of strings.
2. Modify the `enhance()` function to work with this 2D array structure.
3. Update how we extract squares from the grid to use array indexing instead of string operations.
4. Adjust how we join the enhanced grid back together at the end.
