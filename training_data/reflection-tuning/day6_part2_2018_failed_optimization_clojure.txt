The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to unnecessary iterations or calculations. To address this, we should focus on optimizing the algorithm. Here are some potential improvements:

1. Instead of checking every point in an infinite grid, we can determine a reasonable bounding box for our calculations.
2. We can use more efficient data structures, like sets or maps, for faster lookups and calculations.
3. For part two, we can optimize by stopping the distance calculation early if it exceeds the threshold.
4. We can use Clojure's built-in functions for performance, such as `reduce` and `transduce`.

With these optimizations in mind, let's rewrite the solution to be more efficient.
