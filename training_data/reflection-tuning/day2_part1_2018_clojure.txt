To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file line by line.
2. For each line (box ID), count the occurrences of each character.
3. Check if any character appears exactly twice and/or thrice.
4. Keep a running count of IDs with doubles and triples.
5. At the end, multiply these counts to get the checksum.

We'll use Clojure's built-in functions like frequencies, some, and reduce to make the code concise and efficient. The frequencies function will help us count character occurrences quickly, and some will allow us to check for the presence of doubles and triples efficiently.
