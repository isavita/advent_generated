Based on the error message, it seems there are syntax errors in the code. The main issues are:
1. An unexpected closing brace (}) where a declaration or assignment was expected.
2. A non-declaration statement outside of a function body.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that:
1. All variable declarations and assignments are properly formatted.
2. All code statements are inside function bodies.
3. The overall structure of the program is correct, with proper function definitions and main() function.

I'll rewrite the solution, focusing on correct syntax and structure, while implementing the logic for both parts of the problem.
