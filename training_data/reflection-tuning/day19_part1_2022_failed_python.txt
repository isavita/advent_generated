The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using a brute-force approach or an inefficient algorithm to simulate all possible scenarios for 24 minutes. To fix this, we need to implement a more efficient solution using dynamic programming or a depth-first search with pruning.

A depth-first search (DFS) with pruning and some heuristics would be a good approach for this problem. We can implement the following optimizations:

1. Use memoization to avoid recalculating states we've already seen.
2. Implement pruning by checking if it's possible to beat the current best score given the remaining time.
3. Limit the number of robots we build for each resource type based on the maximum cost of any robot for that resource.
4. Use a heuristic to prioritize building geode robots whenever possible.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the search space and improve the execution time.
