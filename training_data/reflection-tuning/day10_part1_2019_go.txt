To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to create a 2D grid of asteroids.
2. For each asteroid, calculate how many other asteroids it can see.
3. To determine visibility, we can use the concept of slope and greatest common divisor (GCD).
4. We'll use a map to keep track of unique slopes from each asteroid to others.
5. The asteroid that can see the most other asteroids is our answer.

The key to efficiency here is using GCD to simplify the slopes and a map to quickly check for unique directions. This approach avoids checking every possible line of sight and instead focuses on unique directions.
