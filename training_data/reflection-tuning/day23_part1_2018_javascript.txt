To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Read and parse the input file to extract nanobot positions and signal radii.
2. Find the nanobot with the largest signal radius.
3. Calculate the Manhattan distance between the strongest nanobot and all other nanobots.
4. Count how many nanobots are within the signal radius of the strongest nanobot.

For efficiency, we'll use a single pass through the input to find the strongest nanobot and store all nanobot data. Then, we'll use another pass to count the nanobots in range. This approach keeps the time complexity at O(n), where n is the number of nanobots.
