To solve this problem, we need to approach it in two steps:

1. For Part 1:
   - Parse the input file to get the coordinates of each cube.
   - Create a set of all cube positions for efficient lookup.
   - For each cube, check its six adjacent positions. If a position is not occupied by another cube, increment the surface area count.

2. For Part 2:
   - We need to find the exterior surface area, excluding any internal air pockets.
   - We can use a flood fill algorithm starting from a point outside the lava droplet.
   - First, determine the bounds of the droplet and create a slightly larger bounding box.
   - Perform a 3D flood fill from a corner of this bounding box, marking all reachable air cubes.
   - Count the surfaces of lava cubes that are adjacent to these reachable air cubes.

This approach will efficiently solve both parts of the problem in a single pass through the data.
