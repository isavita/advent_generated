To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input from the file and parse it into a list of integers.
2. Find the minimum and maximum positions among the crabs.
3. For each position between the minimum and maximum:
   - Calculate the total fuel cost for all crabs to move to that position.
   - Keep track of the minimum fuel cost found so far.
4. Return the minimum fuel cost as the answer.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of crabs and m is the range of positions. To optimize further, we could potentially use a binary search instead of checking every position, but for simplicity and given the problem constraints, the current approach should be sufficient.
