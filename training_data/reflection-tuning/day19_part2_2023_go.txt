To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Parse the workflows and build a map of workflow names to their rules.
2. Implement a recursive function that traverses the workflows, keeping track of the valid ranges for each rating (x, m, a, s).
3. When we reach an 'A' (accept) state, calculate the number of combinations within the current ranges.
4. Sum up all the accepted combinations.

The key to efficiency is to work with ranges instead of individual values, allowing us to process large sets of possibilities at once. We'll use a struct to represent the ranges for each rating, and update these ranges as we traverse the workflows.
