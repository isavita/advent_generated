To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the samples (Before, instruction, After).
2. Implement all 16 opcodes as functions.
3. For each sample, test all 16 opcodes and count how many produce the correct output.
4. Count the number of samples that behave like three or more opcodes.

We'll use a class to represent the CPU state and implement the opcodes as methods. We'll then create a method to test a sample against all opcodes and count the matches. Finally, we'll process all samples and count those with 3 or more matching opcodes.
