To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file and parse it into two parts: replacement rules and the medicine molecule.
2. For each replacement rule, find all occurrences of the 'from' part in the medicine molecule.
3. For each occurrence, create a new molecule by replacing that occurrence with the 'to' part.
4. Keep track of all unique molecules created this way.
5. Count the number of unique molecules and return the result.

We can use a map to store the replacement rules and a set (implemented as a map[string]bool) to keep track of unique molecules. This approach ensures efficiency by avoiding duplicates and allowing fast lookups.
