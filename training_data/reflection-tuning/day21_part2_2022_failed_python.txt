The previous solution seems to have correctly solved Part 1, as the answer 56490240862410 is given as correct. However, for Part 2, the answer 1000000000000000 is likely incorrect, as it's a very round number and doesn't seem to be the result of a complex calculation.

The issue in Part 2 is likely related to how the program is handling the new requirements:
1. The root monkey now needs to check for equality instead of performing an operation.
2. The 'humn' monkey's value needs to be determined to make root's equality check pass.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Modify the root monkey's behavior to check for equality.
2. Implement a binary search or similar algorithm to find the correct value for 'humn' that makes root's equality check pass.
3. Handle the case where 'humn' appears in the calculation tree, making that branch of the tree a variable expression.

The revised solution should include these changes to correctly solve Part 2.
