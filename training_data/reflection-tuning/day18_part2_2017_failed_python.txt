The error message "127" suggests that the previous solution might have been returning an incorrect value or not fully implementing the required functionality. The main issue could be that the solution was only focusing on Part One of the problem and not addressing Part Two, which involves running two instances of the program simultaneously and counting the number of times program 1 sends a value.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Implement a Program class that can run the instructions independently.
2. Create two instances of the Program class, one for program 0 and one for program 1.
3. Implement a way for the programs to communicate through message queues.
4. Count the number of times program 1 sends a value.
5. Handle the deadlock situation when both programs are waiting to receive.

I'll provide a solution that addresses both parts of the problem, with a focus on correctly implementing Part Two.
