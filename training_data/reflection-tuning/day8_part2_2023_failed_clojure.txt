The error message indicates a NullPointerException occurring when trying to call toString() on a null object 's' at line 31 in the solve-part2 function. This suggests that we're trying to process a null value somewhere in our code. 

A common cause for this type of error in this context could be:
1. Incorrectly parsing the input, leading to null values in our data structure.
2. Not properly handling the case where we reach the end of the instruction sequence and need to loop back to the beginning.
3. Possibly not correctly identifying or handling nodes that end with 'Z'.

To fix this, we should ensure that:
1. Our input parsing is robust and doesn't introduce null values.
2. We properly cycle through the instruction sequence.
3. We correctly identify and handle nodes ending with 'A' and 'Z'.
4. We use a more functional approach with map and filter operations to avoid null pointer issues.

Let's revise the solution with these considerations in mind.
