To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a hash to store the monkeys and their jobs. We'll parse the input file and create a hash where each key is a monkey's name, and the value is either a number or an operation with two other monkey names.

We'll then create a recursive function to evaluate each monkey's job. If the monkey's job is a number, we return it. If it's an operation, we recursively evaluate the two monkeys involved in the operation and then perform the operation.

To optimize performance, we can use memoization to cache the results of each monkey's evaluation, so we don't recalculate values unnecessarily.
