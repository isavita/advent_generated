To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse each line as an integer.
2. Use the `partition` function to create pairs of consecutive measurements.
3. Count the number of pairs where the second measurement is greater than the first.

This approach allows us to process the data in a single pass, making it efficient. We'll use Clojure's sequence functions to keep the code concise and functional.
