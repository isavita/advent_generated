The error message indicates that there's a ClassCastException occurring at line 40 of the main.clj file. Specifically, it's trying to cast a Long to an IFn (which is Clojure's interface for callable objects). This suggests that somewhere in the code, we're trying to call a number as if it were a function.

Given the nature of the problem, this error is likely occurring in the part where we're calculating the scenic score. We might be accidentally using a number where we should be using a function. To fix this, we need to review our scenic score calculation logic and ensure we're using functions correctly, especially when dealing with directions and tree heights.

Let's revise the solution, paying special attention to the scenic score calculation part. We'll make sure all our functions are properly defined and used, and that we're not accidentally treating numbers as functions.
