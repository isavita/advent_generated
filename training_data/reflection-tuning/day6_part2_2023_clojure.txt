To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse the time and distance values.
2. For Part 1, we'll calculate the number of ways to win for each race and multiply them together.
3. For Part 2, we'll combine the numbers into a single race and calculate the number of ways to win.
4. To find the number of ways to win, we can use a mathematical approach instead of brute force:
   - The distance traveled is given by the formula: d = t * (T - t), where T is the total time and t is the button hold time.
   - We need to find the range of t where d > record distance.
   - This forms a quadratic inequality: t * (T - t) > R
   - Solving this inequality gives us the range of valid t values.
5. We'll implement a function to calculate this range efficiently.
6. Finally, we'll print the results for both parts.

This approach avoids iterating through all possible times and should be very efficient even for large numbers.
