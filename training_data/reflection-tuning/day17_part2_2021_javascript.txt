To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input to get the target area coordinates.
2. Implement a function to simulate the probe's trajectory.
3. For Part 1, we need to find the maximum height reached by any valid trajectory.
4. For Part 2, we need to count all valid initial velocities.

The key insights are:
- The maximum height is reached when the initial y velocity is positive and as large as possible while still hitting the target.
- We can limit our search space for x and y velocities based on the target area.
- For x, we don't need to go beyond the right edge of the target area.
- For y, we don't need to go below the bottom of the target area or above the absolute value of the bottom (as it will always miss if higher).

We'll use a brute force approach within these limits, as the search space is relatively small.
