To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input to get the boss's stats.
2. Define the available items (weapons, armor, rings).
3. Generate all possible combinations of items (1 weapon, 0-1 armor, 0-2 rings).
4. For each combination, simulate the fight and determine if the player wins.
5. For Part 1, find the least expensive winning combination.
6. For Part 2, find the most expensive losing combination.

We'll use a recursive function to generate item combinations and a separate function to simulate the fight. We'll keep track of the minimum cost to win and the maximum cost to lose.
