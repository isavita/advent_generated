To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the initial configuration from the input file.
2. Create a 2D array to represent the grid of lights.
3. Implement a function to count the number of active neighbors for each light.
4. Create a function to perform one step of the animation, applying the rules to each light.
5. Repeat the animation step 100 times.
6. Count the number of lights that are on after 100 steps.

To optimize performance:
- We can use a single 2D array and update it in-place, swapping between two arrays to avoid creating new arrays in each step.
- We can use bitwise operations to represent on/off states (1 for on, 0 for off).
- We can pre-calculate the grid dimensions to avoid repeated calculations.
