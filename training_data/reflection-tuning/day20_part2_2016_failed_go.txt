The Part 1 answer seems correct, but the Part 2 answer is clearly wrong as it's a massive number that exceeds the maximum possible IP address (4294967295). The issue likely lies in how we're counting the allowed IPs. We might be incorrectly calculating the gaps between ranges or not properly merging overlapping ranges. To fix this, we should ensure we're correctly merging overlapping ranges and then accurately counting the gaps between these merged ranges. We should also make sure we're not overflowing our integer types when doing calculations.
