The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to unnecessary iterations or a suboptimal algorithm. To address this, we should focus on optimizing the cart movement and collision detection process. 

Key optimizations could include:
1. Using a more efficient data structure to represent the track and cart positions, such as a 2D slice for the track and a slice or map for the carts.
2. Implementing a more efficient collision detection algorithm, possibly using a map to quickly check for cart positions.
3. Avoiding unnecessary iterations by only processing active carts and removing crashed carts immediately.
4. Using a single loop to handle both parts of the problem, reducing redundant code.

Let's implement these optimizations in a revised solution.
