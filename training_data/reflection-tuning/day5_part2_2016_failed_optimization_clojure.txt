The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, probably due to a brute-force approach of calculating MD5 hashes for a large number of iterations. To optimize this, we can:

1. Use a more efficient MD5 hashing function.
2. Implement a lazy sequence for generating hashes, allowing us to process them as needed.
3. Use transients for building the password, which are more efficient for multiple updates.
4. Optimize the loop by breaking early when the password is complete.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the execution time while maintaining the correct logic for both parts of the problem.
