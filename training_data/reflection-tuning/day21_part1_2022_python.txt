To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to store the monkeys and their jobs. For monkeys with simple numbers, we can directly store the number. For monkeys with operations, we'll store the operation as a string.

We'll then create a recursive function that evaluates a monkey's job. If it's a number, we return it. If it's an operation, we recursively evaluate the operands and perform the operation.

To make the solution efficient, we'll use memoization to cache the results of each monkey's evaluation, so we don't recalculate the same values multiple times.

The main steps of the solution will be:
1. Parse the input file and create a dictionary of monkeys and their jobs.
2. Create a recursive function to evaluate a monkey's job.
3. Use memoization to optimize the recursive function.
4. Evaluate the 'root' monkey's job and print the result.
