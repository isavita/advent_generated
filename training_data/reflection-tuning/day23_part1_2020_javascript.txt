To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider the following:

1. The circular nature of the cup arrangement suggests using a linked list structure.
2. We need quick access to any cup by its label, which suggests using a Map for O(1) lookups.
3. The operations involve moving cups around, which is efficient with a linked list.

Approach:
1. Create a circular linked list to represent the cups.
2. Use a Map to store references to each cup node for quick access.
3. Implement the move operation as described in the problem.
4. Repeat the move operation 100 times.
5. After 100 moves, traverse the list starting from cup 1 to get the final order.

This approach will be efficient as it avoids array manipulations and uses constant-time operations for most steps.
