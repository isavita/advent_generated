To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Implement a function to check if a point is affected by the tractor beam.
2. For Part 1, scan the 50x50 area and count affected points.
3. For Part 2, we need to find the closest 100x100 square that fits in the beam.
   - We can start from a reasonable position and move diagonally until we find a suitable square.
   - To check if a square fits, we only need to check its top-left and bottom-right corners.
   - Once we find a fitting square, we can return the required calculation.

The key to efficiency is minimizing the number of checks we perform, especially for Part 2.
