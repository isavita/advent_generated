To solve this problem efficiently, we can simulate the process described in the task. Here's the approach:

1. Initialize the scoreboard with the first two recipes: [3, 7].
2. Keep track of the current positions of both elves.
3. Iterate until we have enough recipes (input + 10).
4. In each iteration:
   - Calculate the sum of the current recipes.
   - Add new recipes to the scoreboard based on the sum.
   - Update the positions of the elves.
5. Once we have enough recipes, extract the scores of the ten recipes after the input number.

To make it efficient, we'll use an array to store the scoreboard and only keep track of the necessary information.
