To solve this problem efficiently, we can simulate the process described in the task. Here's the approach:

1. Initialize the scoreboard with the first two recipes (3 and 7).
2. Keep track of the current positions of both Elves.
3. Iterate until we have enough recipes (input + 10).
4. In each iteration:
   - Calculate the sum of the current recipes.
   - Add new recipes based on the sum.
   - Update the Elves' positions.
5. Once we have enough recipes, extract the scores of the ten recipes after the input number.

We'll use a slice to store the recipes, which allows for efficient appending and accessing. To avoid unnecessary string conversions, we'll work with integers throughout the process and only convert to a string at the end for the final output.
