To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization. Here's the thought process:

1. Parse the input file and create a map of monkey names to their jobs.
2. Create a recursive function that evaluates a monkey's job:
   - If the monkey's job is a number, return that number.
   - If it's an operation, recursively evaluate the two operands and perform the operation.
3. Use memoization to store already calculated results to avoid redundant calculations.
4. Start the evaluation from the 'root' monkey.

This approach ensures that we only calculate each monkey's value once and efficiently handle the dependencies between monkeys.
