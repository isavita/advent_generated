To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt"
2. Parse each line to extract the encrypted name, sector ID, and checksum
3. For each room:
   - Count the frequency of each letter in the encrypted name
   - Sort the letters by frequency (descending) and then alphabetically
   - Take the top 5 letters and compare with the checksum
4. Sum the sector IDs of the real rooms

We can use Clojure's built-in functions like frequencies, sort-by, and filter to efficiently implement this logic. We'll use regular expressions to parse the input lines.
