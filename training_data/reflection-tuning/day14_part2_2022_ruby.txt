To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input to create a set of rock positions.
2. Implement a function to simulate sand falling.
3. For Part 1, keep simulating sand until it falls into the abyss.
4. For Part 2, add a floor and continue until the source is blocked.

Key optimizations:
- Use a Set to store rock and sand positions for quick lookups.
- Keep track of the maximum y-coordinate to detect when sand falls into the abyss.
- For Part 2, we can stop when we reach the source coordinates (500,0).

The solution will use a single method to simulate both parts, with a parameter to switch between them.
