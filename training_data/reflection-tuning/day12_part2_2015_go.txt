To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the JSON input from "input.txt"
2. Parse the JSON data
3. Implement a recursive function to traverse the JSON structure
4. Sum all numbers while ignoring objects with "red" property (for Part Two)
5. Use the encoding/json package to unmarshal the JSON data
6. Handle both arrays and objects recursively
7. Check for "red" value in objects and skip if found (Part Two)
8. Return the final sum

We'll use a single function that can handle both Part One and Part Two, with a boolean flag to switch between the two behaviors.
