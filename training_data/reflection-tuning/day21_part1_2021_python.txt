To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game with the given rules. Here's the approach:

1. Read the starting positions from the input file.
2. Initialize player scores, positions, and a die counter.
3. Implement a function to roll the deterministic die.
4. Simulate the game turns, alternating between players:
   - Roll the die three times and move the player.
   - Update the player's score.
   - Check if the player has won (score >= 1000).
5. When a player wins, calculate the result by multiplying the losing player's score by the number of die rolls.

We'll use modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the board and the die rolls efficiently.
