Based on the error message, there are two main issues to address:

1. The "strings" package is imported but not used. We should remove this import if it's not needed for the solution.

2. There's an undefined reference to "bits". This suggests that we might be missing an import for the "math/bits" package, or we're using a function that doesn't exist or is named incorrectly.

To fix these issues, we should:
1. Remove the unused "strings" import.
2. If we need bit manipulation, add the "math/bits" import.
3. Review any usage of bit operations to ensure we're using the correct functions from the math/bits package.

Additionally, we should make sure our solution addresses both parts of the problem: finding the original reflection lines and then finding the new reflection lines after fixing a smudge in each pattern.
