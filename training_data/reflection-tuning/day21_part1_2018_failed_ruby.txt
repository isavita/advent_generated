The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using a brute-force approach, which is inefficient for this problem. The key to solving this efficiently is to analyze the program's behavior and find patterns or shortcuts.

Instead of simulating the entire program for each possible input, we should:

1. Analyze the program to understand its logic.
2. Identify the main loop and the conditions for termination.
3. Reverse-engineer the mathematical operations being performed.
4. Implement a solution that calculates the result directly, rather than simulating each instruction.

This approach will significantly reduce the execution time and avoid the timeout issue.
