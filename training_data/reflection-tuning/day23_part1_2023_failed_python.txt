The error message indicates a RecursionError, which means the DFS function is recursing too deeply. This is likely because the function is not properly backtracking or is revisiting the same nodes multiple times. To fix this, we need to:

1. Implement proper backtracking by removing visited nodes after exploring them.
2. Use a more efficient way to track visited nodes, possibly using a set of tuples instead of modifying the grid.
3. Consider using an iterative approach instead of a recursive one to avoid stack overflow.

Additionally, we should handle the directional slopes correctly, ensuring that we only move in the allowed direction when on a slope.
