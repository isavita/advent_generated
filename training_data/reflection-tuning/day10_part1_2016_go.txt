To solve this problem, we need to simulate the behavior of the bots and track their actions. Here's the approach:

1. Create data structures to represent bots, outputs, and instructions.
2. Parse the input file and store the instructions.
3. Implement a simulation that processes the instructions and moves chips between bots and outputs.
4. During the simulation, check if any bot is comparing the specific values (61 and 17).
5. Return the bot number that compares these values.

We'll use maps to store bots and outputs, and a queue to process instructions. This approach allows for efficient lookup and processing of the simulation.
