The previous solution likely summed all digits in the input without considering the matching condition. To fix this, we need to implement the circular comparison logic and only sum digits that match the next one in the sequence. We should convert the input string to a sequence of digits, then compare each digit with the next one (wrapping around to the first digit for the last comparison). We'll use a combination of map and reduce to achieve this efficiently.
