To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file and parse the wire paths.
2. Convert each wire path into a set of coordinates it passes through.
3. Find the intersections between the two wire paths.
4. Calculate the Manhattan distance for each intersection.
5. Find the minimum distance among all intersections.

We'll use sets to efficiently find intersections and a helper function to generate coordinates for each wire. The Manhattan distance can be calculated by summing the absolute values of x and y coordinates.
