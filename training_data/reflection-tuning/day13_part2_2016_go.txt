To solve this problem, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is essentially what this maze represents. We'll implement the following approach:

1. Create a function to determine if a cell is open or a wall based on the given formula.
2. Implement a BFS function that explores the maze, keeping track of the distance to each cell.
3. For Part 1, we'll run the BFS until we reach the target coordinates (31,39).
4. For Part 2, we'll count the number of distinct locations reachable in at most 50 steps.

We'll use a queue for the BFS and a map to keep track of visited cells and their distances. This approach ensures we explore the maze efficiently and find the shortest path.
