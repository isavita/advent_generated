Based on the incorrect output of 115, it seems the previous solution might have been counting IPs incorrectly. The issue could be in the logic for identifying valid ABBA sequences or in handling the hypernet sequences properly. The solution might have been too permissive in counting IPs as supporting TLS, or it might not have correctly excluded IPs with ABBA sequences within hypernet brackets.

To fix this, we should:
1. Ensure the ABBA detection function is correct (checking for four characters where the first and fourth are the same, the second and third are the same, but the first and second are different).
2. Properly split the IP address into parts outside and inside brackets.
3. Check that there's at least one valid ABBA sequence outside brackets.
4. Ensure there are no valid ABBA sequences inside brackets.
5. Only count an IP as supporting TLS if it meets both conditions 3 and 4.

Let's implement a revised solution with these considerations in mind.
