To solve this problem, we need to implement the Knot Hash algorithm in two parts:

1. For Part One:
   - Initialize a list of 256 numbers from 0 to 255.
   - Parse the input lengths from the file.
   - Implement the knot tying process as described.
   - Multiply the first two numbers in the final list.

2. For Part Two:
   - Convert the input string to ASCII codes.
   - Append the standard suffix (17, 31, 73, 47, 23).
   - Run 64 rounds of the knot tying process.
   - Create the dense hash by XORing blocks of 16 numbers.
   - Convert the dense hash to a hexadecimal string.

We'll create helper functions for each step of the process to keep the main logic clean and readable. We'll also reuse the knot tying logic from Part One in Part Two.
