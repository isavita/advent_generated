The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient or got stuck in an infinite loop. For a problem involving network simulation with 50 computers, the main issue could be in how we're managing the simulation loop. We need to ensure that we're not unnecessarily iterating or waiting for conditions that may never occur.

To fix this, we should:
1. Implement an efficient way to manage the 50 computers, possibly using an array or map.
2. Use a queue system for packets to ensure efficient processing.
3. Implement a main loop that processes all computers in each iteration, but doesn't get stuck waiting for any single computer.
4. Have a condition to break the loop when we find the first packet sent to address 255.
5. Optimize the Intcode computer implementation to ensure it's not causing unnecessary delays.

The revised solution should be able to process the network simulation more efficiently and avoid getting stuck in infinite loops.
