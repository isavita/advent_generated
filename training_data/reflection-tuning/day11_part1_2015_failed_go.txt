To solve this problem, we need to implement the following steps:
1. Read the input password from the file.
2. Implement a function to increment the password.
3. Implement functions to check if the password meets all the requirements.
4. Keep incrementing the password until we find one that meets all the requirements.

For efficiency:
- We'll use byte manipulation instead of string operations when possible.
- We'll use a single loop to check for both the increasing straight and forbidden letters.
- We'll use a map to keep track of pairs for quick lookup.

The main challenge is to implement the increment function correctly, handling the wrapping around of 'z' to 'a' and propagating the increment to the left when needed.
