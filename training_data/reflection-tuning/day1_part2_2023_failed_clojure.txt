The error message suggests that there's an issue with parsing a string that looks like a nested vector structure. This is likely due to an attempt to convert a complex string representation directly into a number. The problem requires parsing each line of input to find the first and last digit, including spelled-out numbers. We need to:

1. Define a map of spelled-out numbers to their digit equivalents.
2. Create a function to find both numeric digits and spelled-out numbers in a string.
3. Extract the first and last "digit" (including spelled-out numbers) from each line.
4. Convert these to actual numbers, combine them, and sum the results.

The previous solution might have tried to handle the input as a nested structure instead of processing it line by line.
