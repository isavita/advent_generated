The previous solution likely had an issue with the logic for counting viable pairs. The error output of 374 suggests that the count was too low, possibly due to missing some valid pairs or incorrectly filtering out viable pairs. To fix this, we need to ensure that we're correctly checking all possible pairs of nodes against the given criteria, without any unnecessary restrictions. We should also double-check our parsing of the input data to ensure we're working with correct values for each node's capacity, used space, and available space.
