To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file line by line.
2. Parse each line into a command (keyword) and a value (integer).
3. Use reduce to accumulate the horizontal position and depth as we process each command.
4. Multiply the final horizontal position and depth to get the result.

We'll use Clojure's built-in functions like slurp, line-seq, and reduce to handle file reading and data processing efficiently. We'll also use destructuring to simplify our code and make it more readable.
