To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file and parse each line into a data structure.
2. Identify all programs that are supporting other programs.
3. Find the program that is not being supported by any other program.

The most efficient approach would be to:
1. Create a set of all program names.
2. Create a set of all programs that are being supported.
3. The difference between these two sets will give us the bottom program.

This approach is efficient as it only requires a single pass through the input data and uses set operations for the final calculation.
