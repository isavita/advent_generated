To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider the following approach:

1. Parse the input file, extracting the spring conditions and group sizes for each row.
2. Implement a dynamic programming solution to count the number of valid arrangements for each row.
3. For Part 2, we need to unfold the input by repeating each row 5 times with slight modifications.
4. Use memoization to optimize the recursive calls in our dynamic programming solution.
5. Sum up the counts for all rows to get the final answer.

The key to efficiency here is the dynamic programming approach with memoization. This will allow us to avoid redundant calculations, especially important for the larger inputs in Part 2.
