The error message indicates a stack overflow due to excessive recursion. This is likely caused by the `flow` and `flow_sideways` methods calling each other repeatedly without a proper base case to stop the recursion. To fix this, we need to restructure our approach to avoid deep recursion. Instead of using recursive calls, we can implement an iterative solution using a queue or stack to keep track of the positions we need to process. This will prevent the stack overflow and allow the program to handle larger inputs efficiently.
