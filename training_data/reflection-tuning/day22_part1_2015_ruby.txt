The error message indicates that the program is trying to require a file or library called "algorithms" which doesn't exist or isn't in the Ruby load path. This suggests that the previous solution might have been trying to use an external library for algorithms, which isn't available in the current environment.

To fix this issue, we need to implement the solution without relying on external libraries. We'll need to create our own data structures and algorithms to simulate the wizard battle and find the least amount of mana needed to win.

The approach I would take is:
1. Define the game state (player health, mana, boss health, active effects)
2. Implement the spells and their effects
3. Use a depth-first search or breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible spell combinations
4. Keep track of the minimum mana spent to win
5. Implement the game logic (turns, damage calculation, effect application)

This solution will be self-contained and won't require any external libraries.
