The error message indicates that no matching rule was found for a particular square. This suggests that our rule matching function is not comprehensive enough or is not handling all possible rotations and flips correctly. To fix this, we need to ensure that our match_rule function considers all possible orientations of the input square before concluding that no match exists. We should implement a more robust rotation and flipping mechanism, and possibly add some debugging output to identify which specific square is causing the issue.
