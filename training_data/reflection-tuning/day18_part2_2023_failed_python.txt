The error message indicates that there's an issue with parsing the hexadecimal code. Specifically, it's trying to convert '#2304' to an integer, which is invalid because it includes the '#' character. To fix this, we need to modify the parse_instruction function to correctly handle the hexadecimal code format described in Part Two of the problem.

The new parsing should:
1. Remove the '#' character from the beginning of the hex code.
2. Use the first 5 digits for the distance (converting from hex to decimal).
3. Use the last digit to determine the direction.

Additionally, we need to update the main logic to use this new parsing method and calculate the area using the shoelace formula and Pick's theorem, as the distances are now much larger.
