To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file line by line.
2. For each line, extract the first and last digit.
3. Combine these digits to form a two-digit number.
4. Sum up all these numbers.

We can use regular expressions to find the first and last digit in each line, which will be efficient for processing. We'll use Clojure's built-in functions for file reading and string manipulation to keep the code concise and idiomatic.
