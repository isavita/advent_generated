To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game with the given rules. Here's the approach:

1. Read the starting positions from the input file.
2. Initialize player scores, positions, and a die counter.
3. Implement a function to roll the deterministic die.
4. Simulate the game turns, alternating between players:
   - Roll the die three times and move the player.
   - Update the player's score.
   - Check if the player has won (score >= 1000).
5. When a player wins, calculate the result by multiplying the losing player's score by the number of die rolls.

We'll use a modulo operation to wrap the die rolls and player positions around their respective ranges (1-100 for die, 1-10 for board).
