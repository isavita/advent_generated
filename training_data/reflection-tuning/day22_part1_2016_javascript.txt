To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to extract node information (x, y coordinates, size, used, and available space).
2. Store the parsed data in an array of node objects.
3. Iterate through the array twice (nested loops) to compare each node with every other node.
4. For each pair, check if it meets the viability criteria:
   - Node A is not empty
   - Node A and B are not the same
   - Node A's used space fits in Node B's available space
5. Count the viable pairs and return the result.

To optimize, we can:
- Use early continue statements to skip unnecessary comparisons.
- Use efficient data structures (objects) for quick access to node properties.
