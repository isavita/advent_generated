To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" and parse it into a vector of integers.
2. Implement the Intcode computer that can execute the given instructions.
3. For Part 1, run the program with noun=12 and verb=2, and return the value at position 0.
4. For Part 2, implement a search function that tries different noun and verb combinations until we find the one that produces the desired output.
5. Optimize by using Clojure's efficient data structures and functions.

We'll use a vector to represent the memory, as it allows for efficient updates. We'll implement the Intcode computer as a function that takes the initial memory state and returns the final state. For Part 2, we'll use a nested loop to search for the correct noun and verb.
