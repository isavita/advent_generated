To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file line by line
2. Start from the '5' button
3. For each line, process the instructions (U, D, L, R) to move on the keypad
4. Keep track of the current position and ensure we don't move off the keypad
5. After processing each line, record the final button for that line
6. Combine all the final buttons to get the bathroom code

We can represent the keypad as a 2D vector and use coordinates to track the current position. We'll use a helper function to process each move and ensure we stay within the keypad bounds.
