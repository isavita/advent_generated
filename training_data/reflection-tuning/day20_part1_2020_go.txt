To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to extract tile information (ID and borders).
2. Find matching borders between tiles.
3. Identify corner tiles (tiles with only two matching borders).
4. Multiply the IDs of the corner tiles.

The key insights are:
- We only need to consider the borders of each tile, not the entire tile content.
- Corner tiles will have exactly two borders that match with other tiles.
- We can use a map to efficiently store and look up border patterns.

For efficiency, we'll:
- Store borders as strings for easy comparison.
- Use a map to count how many times each border appears across all tiles.
- Use another map to store tiles by their ID for easy access.
