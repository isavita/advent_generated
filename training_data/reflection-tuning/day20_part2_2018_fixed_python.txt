The error message indicates that we're trying to unpack an integer as if it were an iterable, specifically in the line "for x, y in positions:". This suggests that 'positions' is sometimes an integer instead of a list or tuple of coordinates as expected.

To fix this, we need to ensure that 'positions' is always a list or tuple, even when it represents a single position. We can do this by wrapping the position in a list if it's not already iterable.

Additionally, the error occurs in the parse_regex function, which suggests that we need to modify how we handle positions throughout the regex parsing process.
