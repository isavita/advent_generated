To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to create a list of Aunts Sue with their attributes.
2. Define the MFCSAM readings.
3. For Part 1, find the Aunt Sue that matches all the MFCSAM readings exactly.
4. For Part 2, find the Aunt Sue that matches the MFCSAM readings with the new interpretation:
   - 'cats' and 'trees' should be greater than the MFCSAM reading
   - 'pomeranians' and 'goldfish' should be less than the MFCSAM reading
   - Other attributes should match exactly

We'll use a hash to store the MFCSAM readings and an array of hashes for the Aunts Sue. Then, we'll iterate through the Aunts Sue to find the matches for both parts.
