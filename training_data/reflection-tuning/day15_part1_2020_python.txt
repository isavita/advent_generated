To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the last turn each number was spoken. This allows us to quickly look up whether a number has been spoken before and when it was last spoken. We'll iterate through the turns, updating the dictionary and calculating the next number based on the rules given.

The steps will be:
1. Initialize a dictionary with the starting numbers and their positions.
2. Keep track of the last number spoken.
3. Iterate from the length of the starting numbers + 1 to 2020.
4. For each turn, check if the last number is in the dictionary (excluding its most recent occurrence).
5. Calculate the next number based on this information.
6. Update the dictionary with the new number and its turn.
7. After 2020 turns, return the last number spoken.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of turns (2020 in this case), and a space complexity of O(m) where m is the number of unique numbers spoken.
