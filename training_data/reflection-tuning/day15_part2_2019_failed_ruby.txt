The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using an inefficient approach, possibly exploring the entire map repeatedly or using a slow algorithm for pathfinding. To fix this, we should implement a more efficient exploration and pathfinding algorithm. 

A good approach would be to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the map and find the oxygen system. This will guarantee the shortest path to the oxygen system. For the second part, we can use the same BFS approach to simulate the oxygen spread.

To optimize further, we can use a hash set to keep track of visited positions, which will allow for faster lookups compared to an array. We'll also use a queue for the BFS implementation to ensure we're exploring the map efficiently.

For the Intcode computer, we'll assume it's already implemented and focus on the exploration and oxygen spread simulation.
