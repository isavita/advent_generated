To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file line by line.
2. For each line, split it into supernet and hypernet sequences.
3. Implement functions to check for ABBA and ABA patterns.
4. For Part 1, count IPs that have ABBA in supernet but not in hypernet.
5. For Part 2, find ABA patterns in supernet and check for corresponding BAB in hypernet.
6. Use efficient string processing and avoid unnecessary computations.
7. Utilize Clojure's built-in functions for string manipulation and sequence processing.
