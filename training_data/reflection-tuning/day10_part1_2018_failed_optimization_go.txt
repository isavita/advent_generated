The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to running the simulation for too many iterations or using an inefficient method to detect when the message appears. To fix this, we can implement a more efficient approach:

1. Instead of simulating for a fixed number of steps, we can calculate the bounding box of all points at each step.
2. We can assume that the message appears when the bounding box is at its smallest area, as this is when the points are closest together.
3. We'll keep track of the minimum area and the corresponding step.
4. We'll stop the simulation if the area starts increasing again, as this indicates we've passed the point where the message appeared.
5. Finally, we'll print the positions of the points at the step with the minimum area.

This approach should be much faster as it avoids unnecessary iterations and uses a more intelligent stopping condition.
