To solve this problem efficiently, we need to simulate the process of creating recipes and tracking the positions of the two elves. Here's the approach:

1. Initialize the scoreboard with the first two recipes (3 and 7).
2. Keep track of the current positions of both elves.
3. For Part 1:
   - Continue creating new recipes until we have the required number plus 10 more.
   - Return the scores of the 10 recipes after the input number.
4. For Part 2:
   - Continue creating new recipes while checking if the last few digits match the input sequence.
   - Return the number of recipes before the matching sequence.

To optimize the solution:
- Use a slice to store the recipes, which allows for efficient appending and indexing.
- For Part 2, use a rolling window to check for the matching sequence instead of converting the entire slice to a string each time.
