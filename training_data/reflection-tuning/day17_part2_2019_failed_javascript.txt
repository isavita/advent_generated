Based on the incorrect output (Part 1: 0, Part 2: 10), it seems the previous solution didn't correctly implement the scaffold intersection detection for Part 1 and likely had an incomplete implementation for Part 2. The main issues to address are:

1. For Part 1, we need to properly parse the ASCII output, identify scaffold intersections, and calculate their alignment parameters.
2. For Part 2, we need to implement the movement logic for the vacuum robot, including the main routine and movement functions.

To fix these issues, we should:
1. Implement a function to parse the ASCII output and create a 2D grid of the scaffolding.
2. Create a function to identify intersections and calculate alignment parameters.
3. Implement the movement logic for the vacuum robot, including the ability to input movement instructions.
4. Set up the main routine and movement functions as specified in the problem.

Let's create a revised solution addressing these points.
