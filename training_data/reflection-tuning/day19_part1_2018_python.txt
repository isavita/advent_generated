To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the instruction pointer binding and the list of instructions.
2. Implement the different opcodes (seti, setr, addi, addr, etc.).
3. Create a function to execute the program, keeping track of the registers and instruction pointer.
4. Run the program until it halts (when the instruction pointer goes out of bounds).
5. Return the value in register 0 at the end of execution.

We'll create a class to represent the CPU and implement the opcodes as methods. The main execution loop will update the instruction pointer and registers according to the rules described in the problem.
