The previous solution seems to have produced incorrect results for both Part 1 and Part 2. The main issue is likely in the implementation of the game simulation and the strategy for finding the least amount of mana spent to win.

To fix this, we should:
1. Ensure all game rules are correctly implemented, including spell effects, boss attacks, and player turns.
2. Implement a more efficient search algorithm, possibly using a breadth-first search or A* algorithm to find the optimal solution.
3. Carefully handle the hard mode for Part 2, where the player loses 1 hit point at the start of each turn.
4. Use a priority queue to explore the most promising game states first, prioritizing by mana spent.
5. Implement proper state management to avoid revisiting already explored game states.

The revised solution should be more thorough in its exploration of possible game states while being efficient enough to find the optimal solution in a reasonable time.
