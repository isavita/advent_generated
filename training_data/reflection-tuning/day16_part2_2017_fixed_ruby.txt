Based on the incorrect output, it seems the previous solution might have implemented the dance moves correctly for Part One, but failed to properly handle the repetition for Part Two. The issue likely lies in not recognizing that the dance sequence will eventually repeat, forming a cycle. Instead of actually performing a billion dances, we should find the cycle length and use modular arithmetic to determine the final state.

To fix this, we should:
1. Implement the dance moves correctly (which seems to be done already for Part One).
2. For Part Two, perform the dance repeatedly while keeping track of the states we've seen.
3. Once we detect a cycle, calculate how many dances are left after removing full cycles.
4. Perform only the necessary number of dances to reach the billionth state.

This approach will significantly reduce the computation time and solve the problem correctly.
