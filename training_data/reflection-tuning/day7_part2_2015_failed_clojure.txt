The error message indicates a NullPointerException, which suggests that we're trying to perform an operation on a null value. This often happens when we're trying to process input that doesn't exist or hasn't been properly initialized. In the context of this problem, it's likely that we're attempting to apply a regex operation on a null string, possibly when parsing the input.

To fix this, we should ensure that:
1. The input is properly read and not null.
2. We handle empty lines or unexpected input formats gracefully.
3. We use proper error handling and input validation.

Additionally, we should make sure our circuit simulation logic is robust and handles all possible gate types and wire connections correctly.
