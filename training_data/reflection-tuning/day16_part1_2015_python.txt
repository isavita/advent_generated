To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file containing information about all 500 Aunt Sues.
2. Create a dictionary of the MFCSAM results.
3. Compare each Aunt Sue's attributes with the MFCSAM results.
4. Find the Aunt Sue that matches all known attributes.

The most efficient approach would be to:
- Store the MFCSAM results in a dictionary for quick lookup.
- Parse each Aunt Sue's information and immediately compare it with the MFCSAM results.
- If all attributes match, we've found our Aunt Sue.

We'll use regular expressions to parse the input efficiently.
