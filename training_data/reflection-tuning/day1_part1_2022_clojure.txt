To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file
2. Split the input into groups of numbers separated by blank lines
3. Sum each group of numbers
4. Find the maximum sum

We can approach this efficiently by:
- Using Clojure's built-in functions for file reading and string manipulation
- Utilizing the `reduce` function to process the input in a single pass
- Keeping track of the maximum sum as we process each group

This approach will be both memory-efficient (as we don't need to store all groups) and time-efficient (as we process the input in one pass).
