To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to separate rules and messages.
2. Create a data structure to represent the rules.
3. Implement a recursive function to match messages against rules.
4. Count the number of messages that completely match rule 0.

For efficiency, we can:
- Use a map to store rules for quick lookup.
- Implement memoization to avoid redundant computations in the recursive matching function.
- Use strings.Builder for efficient string concatenation when needed.

The main challenge is handling the recursive nature of the rules and the OR conditions.
