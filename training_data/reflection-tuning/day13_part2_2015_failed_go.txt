To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to create a map of happiness relationships between people.
2. Implement a recursive function to generate all possible seating arrangements.
3. For each arrangement, calculate the total happiness change.
4. Keep track of the maximum happiness change.
5. For Part Two, add ourselves to the list with 0 happiness relationships.

We'll use a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate all permutations of seating arrangements. To optimize, we can use a bitmask to keep track of seated people and avoid unnecessary allocations.

For Part Two, we'll simply add ourselves to the happiness map and rerun the algorithm with the updated list of people.
