To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the drawn numbers and bingo boards.
2. Implement a function to check if a board has won.
3. Simulate the bingo game by marking numbers on boards and checking for winners after each draw.
4. Calculate the score of the winning board.

The approach will be:
- Read and parse the input file.
- Create data structures for the boards and drawn numbers.
- Iterate through the drawn numbers, marking them on each board.
- After each number is drawn, check all boards for a win condition.
- When a win is found, calculate and return the score.

For efficiency, we'll use sets to represent marked numbers on each board, allowing for quick lookups and win condition checks.
