The error message "0" suggests that the previous solution might have been returning zero as the result, which is incorrect for this problem. The issue likely stems from not properly parsing the input, not correctly building the graph of bag relationships, or not implementing the recursive search for bags that can contain a shiny gold bag.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. We correctly parse the input into a map of bag colors to their contents.
2. We implement a function to recursively search for bags that can contain a shiny gold bag.
3. We count the unique bag colors that can eventually contain a shiny gold bag.

The solution should involve building a graph-like structure and then performing a depth-first search or breadth-first search to find all bags that can contain a shiny gold bag, either directly or indirectly.
