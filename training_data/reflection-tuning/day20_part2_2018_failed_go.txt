The error message indicates that the "math" package was imported but not used in the code. This suggests that the previous solution might have included an unnecessary import statement for the "math" package. To fix this issue, we should remove the unused import statement. Additionally, since we're dealing with a complex problem involving regex parsing and path finding, we'll need to implement a solution that can handle the regex input and calculate the required distances.
