Based on the incorrect output provided, it seems the previous solution might have had issues with the logic for updating the lights or handling the corner lights in Part 2. The main areas to focus on would be:

1. Ensuring the correct rules are applied for turning lights on and off.
2. Properly handling the edge cases, especially for lights on the borders of the grid.
3. For Part 2, making sure the corner lights are always on and not affected by the rules.
4. Verifying that the grid is being updated correctly for each step, without modifying the current state while calculating the next state.

To address these issues, I would implement a solution that clearly separates the logic for updating the grid, counting neighbors, and handling the special case for corner lights in Part 2. I would also ensure that a new grid is created for each step to avoid modifying the current state while calculating the next state.
