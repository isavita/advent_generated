To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file line by line.
2. For each line, split it into numbers and convert them to integers.
3. Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values for each row.
4. Sum up all these differences to get the final checksum.

We can use Clojure's built-in functions like `slurp` to read the file, `clojure.string/split` to split each line, `map` to convert strings to integers, and `reduce` to calculate the sum. The `apply` function will help us find the max and min values easily.
