Based on the output provided, it seems that Part One was solved correctly (642), but Part Two's answer (4) is likely incorrect. The issue might be in the implementation of Part Two, where we need to determine the actual opcode numbers and then execute the test program.

The error could be in one of these areas:
1. Incorrect mapping of opcode numbers to operations
2. Faulty execution of the test program
3. Incorrect initialization or handling of registers during test program execution

To fix this, we should:
1. Ensure we correctly deduce the opcode numbers from the samples
2. Implement a proper execution function for the test program
3. Carefully initialize and update the registers during execution

Let's revise the code to address these potential issues.
