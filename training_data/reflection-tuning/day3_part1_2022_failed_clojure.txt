The error message indicates that there's a problem with importing the clojure.set namespace. This is likely because the namespace wasn't properly required at the beginning of the file. To fix this, we need to add a require statement for clojure.set. Additionally, the error suggests that the code might be using some deprecated features, so we should ensure we're using the most up-to-date Clojure syntax and best practices.

Another potential issue could be in how we're splitting the rucksack contents and finding the common item. We should make sure we're correctly dividing the string into two halves and using efficient set operations to find the common element.

Lastly, we need to ensure that we're correctly calculating the priority of each item type based on its ASCII value.
