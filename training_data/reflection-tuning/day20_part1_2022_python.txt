To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt"
2. Implement the mixing algorithm
3. Find the grove coordinates
4. Calculate and print the sum

The key challenge is implementing the mixing algorithm efficiently. We can use a circular doubly linked list to represent the sequence, which allows for O(1) insertions and deletions. To keep track of the original order, we'll use a separate list of nodes.

For the mixing process, we'll iterate through the original order, move each number, and update the linked list accordingly. After mixing, we'll find the node with value 0 and count to get the grove coordinates.
