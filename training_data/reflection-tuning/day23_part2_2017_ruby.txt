The previous solution likely calculated the correct answer for Part 1 of the problem (3025), but didn't address Part 2. The error output of 907 suggests that the solution attempted to solve Part 2 but produced an incorrect result. 

To fix this, we need to implement the full program simulation for Part 2, where register 'a' starts at 1 instead of 0. The key challenge in Part 2 is optimization, as running the program naively would take too long. We need to analyze the program's logic and find a way to calculate the final value of register 'h' without actually running all the instructions.

Upon careful analysis of typical assembly-like programs in these puzzles, it's likely that the program is implementing a complex calculation, possibly involving nested loops. The optimization likely involves identifying the mathematical pattern and implementing it directly in Ruby, rather than simulating each instruction.
