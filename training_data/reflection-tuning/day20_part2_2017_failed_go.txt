The previous solution seems to have correctly solved Part 1, as the answer 125 is given as correct. However, the solution for Part 2 is incorrect, as 1000 particles remaining after collisions seems too high.

The main issue is likely in the collision detection and resolution for Part 2. Here are potential problems and solutions:

1. The collision detection might not be checking all dimensions (X, Y, and Z).
2. The collision resolution might not be removing all colliding particles.
3. The simulation might not be running for enough ticks to resolve all collisions.
4. There might be an issue with how particles are being updated or compared.

To fix these issues, we should:
1. Ensure we're checking all three dimensions for collisions.
2. Implement a proper collision detection and resolution system.
3. Run the simulation for a sufficient number of ticks or until no more collisions occur.
4. Double-check the particle update logic to ensure it's correct.

Let's revise the code with these considerations in mind.
