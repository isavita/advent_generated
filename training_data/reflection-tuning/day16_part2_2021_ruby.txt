To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Convert the hexadecimal input to binary
2. Parse the binary data to extract packets and their sub-packets
3. Implement a recursive function to evaluate packets based on their type ID
4. For Part 1, sum up all version numbers
5. For Part 2, evaluate the expression represented by the packets

We'll use a class to represent packets and implement methods for parsing and evaluating. The main challenge is to correctly handle the different packet types and their nested structure.
