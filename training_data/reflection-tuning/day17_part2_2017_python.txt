To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider two key points:

1. For Part One, we can simulate the spinlock process directly, as the number of iterations (2017) is relatively small.

2. For Part Two, simulating 50 million insertions would be too slow. However, we only need to track the value that comes after 0, which is always at index 1 in the circular buffer. We can optimize by only keeping track of the current position and the value at index 1, without storing the entire buffer.

For Part One, we'll use a list to represent the circular buffer and simulate the process as described.

For Part Two, we'll use a single variable to keep track of the value after 0, updating it only when a new value is inserted at index 1.

This approach will be much more efficient for the large number of iterations in Part Two.
