To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt"
2. Initialize a string representing the initial order of programs (a to p)
3. Parse each dance move and apply it to our string
4. For each move type:
   - Spin (s): Use string slicing to move the last X characters to the front
   - Exchange (x): Swap characters at given indices
   - Partner (p): Find the indices of the given characters and swap them
5. After applying all moves, print the final order of programs

We'll use a single string to represent the program order and manipulate it directly for efficiency. We'll also use regular expressions to parse the dance moves quickly.
