To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Read the input from the file to get the depth and target coordinates.
2. Create a function to calculate the geologic index for each region.
3. Create a function to calculate the erosion level for each region.
4. Create a function to determine the type of each region.
5. Calculate the risk level for each region in the rectangle from (0,0) to the target.
6. Sum up all the risk levels to get the total risk level.

We'll use a 2D array to store the erosion levels of each region, which will help us avoid recalculating values for regions we've already processed. This will significantly improve the efficiency of our solution.
