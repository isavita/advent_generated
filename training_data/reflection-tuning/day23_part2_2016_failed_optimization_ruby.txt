The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to a large number of iterations or a complex algorithm. For this type of assembly-like problem, the main issue is often related to the implementation of the 'tgl' instruction or inefficient handling of the register operations.

To address this, we should focus on optimizing the execution of instructions, especially the 'tgl' instruction. We can implement a more efficient way to handle register operations and instruction toggling. Additionally, we should consider using a hash to store register values for faster access and modification.

Another optimization could be to implement a way to detect loops or repetitive patterns in the instruction execution, which could help us predict the final state without executing all instructions.

Lastly, for Part Two, where we need to handle a larger input (12 instead of 7), we might need to implement a mathematical approach to calculate the result rather than simulating all steps, as the number of iterations might grow exponentially.
