The error message indicates that the `ord()` function is receiving a string of length 2 instead of a single character. This suggests that the valve names in our input are not single characters as assumed in the original code. The bitmask approach using `ord(valve) - ord('A')` won't work for multi-character valve names.

To fix this, we need to modify our approach:
1. Instead of using a bitmask, we can use a set to keep track of opened valves.
2. We should use a dictionary to map valve names to their indices for efficient lookup.
3. We need to adjust the DFS function to work with these changes.
4. The input parsing needs to be updated to handle multi-character valve names.

This new approach will be more flexible and able to handle valve names of any length.
