To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract hailstone positions and velocities.
2. Implement a function to check if two hailstones' paths intersect within the given test area.
3. Iterate through all pairs of hailstones and count the intersections.

For the intersection check:
- We'll use linear algebra to find the intersection point of two lines.
- We need to ensure the intersection happens in the future for both hailstones.
- We'll check if the intersection point is within the test area.

To optimize:
- We'll use numpy for efficient vector operations.
- We'll use itertools.combinations to iterate through pairs efficiently.
