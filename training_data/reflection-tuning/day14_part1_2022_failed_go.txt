The previous solution likely had an issue with the simulation logic or the boundary conditions. The output of 702 units of sand seems too high for this problem, as the example given shows only 24 units of sand coming to rest before flowing into the abyss. The error might be in how the simulation determines when sand starts flowing into the abyss, or there could be an infinite loop allowing more sand to accumulate than it should.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. The simulation correctly detects when sand starts flowing into the abyss.
2. The boundaries of the cave are properly defined and respected.
3. The movement of sand follows the correct rules (down, down-left, down-right).
4. We have a proper stopping condition for the simulation.

I'll revise the solution with these considerations in mind, implementing a more careful simulation of the sand falling process and ensuring we stop when sand starts flowing into the abyss.
