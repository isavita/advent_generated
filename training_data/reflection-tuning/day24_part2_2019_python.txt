To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider the following points:
1. We're dealing with a 3D grid (2D space + recursion level).
2. We need to keep track of the state of each cell at each level.
3. The rules for bug reproduction and death are based on adjacent cells, including cells from adjacent levels.
4. We need to simulate 200 minutes of evolution.

Approach:
1. Read the initial state from the input file.
2. Create a data structure to represent the 3D grid. A dictionary with tuple keys (level, row, col) would be efficient.
3. Implement a function to count adjacent bugs, considering the recursive nature of the grid.
4. Implement a function to evolve the grid for one minute.
5. Repeat the evolution 200 times.
6. Count the total number of bugs after 200 minutes.

To optimize for speed and memory:
- Use sets to store only the positions of bugs, rather than the entire grid.
- Only create new levels when bugs appear on the edge of existing levels.
- Use a helper function to generate adjacent positions, including those from adjacent levels.
