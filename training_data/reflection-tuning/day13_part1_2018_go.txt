Based on the incorrect output of "140,97", it seems the previous solution might have been tracking the wrong coordinates or misinterpreting the input. The error could be due to:

1. Incorrect parsing of the input map
2. Wrong logic for cart movement or collision detection
3. Mishandling of the coordinate system (possibly reversing X and Y)

To fix this, we need to ensure:
1. Proper parsing of the input map, including tracks and carts
2. Correct implementation of cart movement rules
3. Accurate collision detection
4. Proper handling of the coordinate system (X should be horizontal, Y vertical)

I'll revise the solution keeping these points in mind, focusing on correctly implementing the cart movement and collision detection logic.
