The error message indicates that there's a NumberFormatException when trying to parse the string "through" as a number. This suggests that the code is attempting to convert all parts of the input string into numbers, including the word "through" which separates the coordinate pairs. To fix this, we need to parse the input string more carefully, separating the coordinates from the instruction words ("turn on", "turn off", "toggle") and the "through" keyword. We should split the input string appropriately and only convert the actual coordinate values to numbers.
