To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input from the file "input.txt" as a string.
2. Convert the string into a sequence of digits.
3. Implement two functions: one for Part 1 and another for Part 2.
4. For Part 1, compare each digit with the next one (wrapping around at the end).
5. For Part 2, compare each digit with the one halfway around the list.
6. Sum up the matching digits in each case.
7. Print both results.

We'll use Clojure's sequence functions to make the code concise and efficient.
