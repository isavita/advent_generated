To solve this problem, we need to implement an Intcode computer with the specified opcodes and parameter modes. Here's the approach:

1. Read the input from "input.txt" and parse it into a vector of integers.
2. Implement a function to execute the Intcode program:
   - Use a loop to process instructions until we reach a halt opcode (99).
   - For each instruction, decode the opcode and parameter modes.
   - Implement each opcode (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) with support for parameter modes.
   - Use a mutable array (transient vector) for better performance when modifying memory.
3. Run the program twice:
   - First with input 1 for Part One
   - Then with input 5 for Part Two
4. Print the final output for each part, which will be our diagnostic codes.

This approach should efficiently solve both parts of the problem in a single run.
