The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using an inefficient algorithm, possibly a brute-force approach or a depth-first search without proper optimization. To fix this, we should implement a more efficient algorithm, such as a breadth-first search (BFS) with some optimizations:

1. Use BFS to find the shortest path between keys and the starting point.
2. Implement a bitmasking technique to keep track of collected keys efficiently.
3. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always explore the most promising paths first.
4. Implement memoization to avoid recalculating paths for states we've already seen.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the time complexity and allow the solution to complete within the time limit.
