To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Parse the input to extract tile IDs and their corresponding tile data.
2. Identify the edges of each tile.
3. Find matching edges between tiles.
4. Identify corner tiles (tiles with only two matching edges).
5. Multiply the IDs of the corner tiles.

The key to efficiency here is to use a hash map to store the edges and quickly find matches. We'll use a binary representation of edges to make comparisons easier and allow for flipped edges.
