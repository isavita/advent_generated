To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the initial state from the input file.
2. Implement a function to simulate one minute of change.
3. Repeat the simulation for 10 minutes.
4. Count the number of wooded acres and lumberyards.
5. Calculate and return the total resource value.

The key to efficiency here is to use a 2D slice to represent the grid and update it in-place. We'll use a double buffer approach to avoid conflicts during updates. We'll also use constants for the different types of acres to make the code more readable.
