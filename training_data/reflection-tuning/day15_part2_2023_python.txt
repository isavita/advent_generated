To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Implement the HASH algorithm as described.
2. Create a data structure to represent the 256 boxes and their contents.
3. Process each step in the initialization sequence, updating the boxes accordingly.
4. Calculate the focusing power of the final lens configuration.

For the data structure, we can use a list of 256 elements, where each element is a list of tuples (label, focal_length). This allows for efficient insertion, removal, and updating of lenses in each box.

We'll implement the HASH algorithm as a separate function for clarity. Then, we'll process each step in the sequence, updating our boxes structure as we go. Finally, we'll calculate the focusing power based on the final configuration.
