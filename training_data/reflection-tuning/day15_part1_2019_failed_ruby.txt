The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using an inefficient approach, possibly exploring the entire map or using a brute-force method. To fix this, we should implement a more efficient search algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is essentially what this maze-like problem represents.

The key improvements would be:
1. Use a queue for BFS to efficiently explore the map.
2. Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting.
3. Stop the search as soon as we find the oxygen system.
4. Use a hash to store the map, only adding positions as we discover them.

This approach should be much faster as it won't explore unnecessary paths and will terminate as soon as the solution is found.
