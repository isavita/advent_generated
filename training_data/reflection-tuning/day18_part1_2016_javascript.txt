To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input from the file.
2. Create a function to generate the next row based on the current row.
3. Keep track of the total safe tiles as we generate each row.
4. Iterate 40 times (including the initial row) to generate all rows.
5. Return the total count of safe tiles.

The key to efficiency here is to:
- Only store the current row in memory, as we don't need to keep all rows.
- Count safe tiles as we go, rather than storing all rows and counting at the end.
- Use bitwise operations for checking trap conditions, which is faster than string comparisons.
