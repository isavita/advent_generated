To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input rules into a hash for quick lookup.
2. Implement a function to split the grid into smaller squares (2x2 or 3x3).
3. Create a function to apply the rules to each square, including rotations and flips.
4. Implement a function to join the enhanced squares back into a larger grid.
5. Iterate the process for the required number of times.
6. Count the number of '#' pixels in the final grid.

To optimize for larger iterations:
- Use a set or a sparse representation for the grid to avoid storing unnecessary '.' pixels.
- Implement memoization for pattern matching to avoid redundant calculations.
- Use bitwise operations for faster pattern matching and transformations.
