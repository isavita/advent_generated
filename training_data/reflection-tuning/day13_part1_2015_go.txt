To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the happiness values for each pair of people.
2. Generate all possible seating arrangements (permutations) of the guests.
3. Calculate the total happiness for each arrangement.
4. Find the maximum happiness value among all arrangements.

The key challenges are:
- Efficiently storing and accessing the happiness values (we can use a map of maps).
- Generating all permutations (we can use a recursive approach).
- Handling the circular nature of the table (we need to consider the first and last person as neighbors).

We'll use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to generate permutations and calculate happiness simultaneously, which is more memory-efficient than generating all permutations first.
