The error message indicates a ClassCastException, specifically that a PersistentVector cannot be cast to ITransientAssociative. This suggests that we're trying to use a transient operation on a persistent vector, which is not allowed. The error occurs in the update-grid function, likely when we're trying to update the grid.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we're using the correct data structures and operations. Instead of trying to use transient operations on a persistent vector, we should either:

1. Use persistent operations throughout (which might be slower but simpler)
2. Convert the grid to a transient form before updating, then convert it back to persistent after all updates

Given the size of the grid (1000x1000), using transients could provide a performance boost. So, let's implement the second approach.
