To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" and store it as a 2D grid.
2. Find the starting point (the first '|' in the top row).
3. Implement a function to traverse the path, following the rules:
   - Move in the current direction until a turn is needed.
   - Turn only when there's no other option (at '+').
   - Collect letters along the way.
   - Stop when we reach the end of the path.
4. Keep track of the direction, position, and collected letters.
5. Handle different characters: '|', '-', '+', letters, and spaces.

The solution will use a simple state machine approach, moving step by step and changing direction when necessary.
