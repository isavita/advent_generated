To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" and parse the components.
2. Implement a recursive depth-first search (DFS) function to explore all possible bridges.
3. Keep track of the strongest bridge found so far.
4. Use a set to keep track of used components to avoid duplicates.
5. Start the search with components that have a 0-pin port.
6. Calculate the strength of each valid bridge and update the maximum strength.

The DFS approach allows us to explore all possible combinations efficiently. We'll use backtracking to try different paths and a set to keep track of used components, ensuring we don't use the same component twice in a bridge.
