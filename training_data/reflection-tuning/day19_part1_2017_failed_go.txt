Based on the error message "index out of range [-1]", it seems the issue is likely related to accessing an array or slice with an invalid index. This often happens when we're trying to access an element at index -1, which is not a valid index in Go. 

The error is occurring in the main function, so it's probably in a loop or condition where we're manipulating indices. A common mistake is decrementing an index without properly checking if it's already at 0, or using an index before checking if it's valid.

To fix this, we should:
1. Ensure all array/slice accesses are within bounds.
2. Add checks to prevent the index from becoming negative.
3. Be careful with loop conditions and index manipulations.

Let's revise the code with these considerations in mind.
