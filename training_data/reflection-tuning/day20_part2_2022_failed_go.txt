To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the following approach:

1. Read the input numbers from the file.
2. Create a slice of structs that contain both the original value and its initial position.
3. Implement a mixing function that moves each number according to its value.
4. For Part 1, mix the numbers once.
5. For Part 2, apply the decryption key and mix the numbers 10 times.
6. Find the position of 0 and calculate the sum of the 1000th, 2000th, and 3000th numbers after it.

To handle large numbers and wrapping around the list efficiently, we can use modular arithmetic to calculate the new position of each number.
