Based on the given output, it seems that the previous solution correctly solved Part One (finding the particle that stays closest to <0,0,0>), but the answer for Part Two is incorrect. The main issue is likely in the collision detection and resolution for Part Two.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Implement a proper collision detection mechanism that checks for particles with the same position after each tick.
2. Remove collided particles from the simulation.
3. Continue the simulation for a sufficient number of ticks to ensure all collisions have occurred.
4. Count the remaining particles after all collisions have been resolved.

The previous solution might have missed some collisions or didn't run the simulation for long enough to catch all potential collisions. We'll implement a more robust collision detection system and run the simulation for a larger number of ticks to ensure we catch all collisions.
