To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the initial configuration from the input file.
2. Create a function to count neighbors for each light.
3. Implement the rules for updating lights in each step.
4. Create separate functions for Part 1 and Part 2 to handle the different rules.
5. Run the simulation for 100 steps for both parts.
6. Count the number of lights on after 100 steps.

For efficiency:
- Use a 2D array to represent the grid.
- Only update the state in-place after checking all lights in each step.
- Use modulo arithmetic to handle edge cases for neighbor counting.
