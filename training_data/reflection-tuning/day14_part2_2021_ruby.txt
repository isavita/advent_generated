To solve this problem efficiently, we need to realize that storing the entire polymer string becomes impractical for large numbers of steps. Instead, we can keep track of the count of each pair of characters and the count of individual characters. 

Here's the approach:
1. Parse the input to get the initial template and the insertion rules.
2. Create a hash to store the count of each pair in the template.
3. Create a hash to store the count of each character in the template.
4. For each step:
   - Create a new pair count hash.
   - For each pair in the current pair count:
     - Get the character to insert between this pair.
     - Update the new pair count for the two new pairs formed.
     - Update the character count for the inserted character.
   - Replace the old pair count with the new one.
5. After all steps, find the most and least common elements from the character count.
6. Calculate and return the difference between the most and least common elements.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of steps and m is the number of unique pairs, which is much more efficient than storing and manipulating the entire polymer string.
