The previous solution likely had an issue with the order of operations. The problem states that addition and multiplication should have the same precedence and be evaluated left-to-right, regardless of the traditional order of operations. The incorrect output suggests that the previous solution might have been evaluating multiplication before addition, or not handling parentheses correctly.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. We evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.
2. Outside of parentheses, we evaluate operations strictly from left to right.
3. We handle nested parentheses correctly.

I'll implement a recursive function to evaluate expressions, using a stack to keep track of operations and values. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we'll evaluate the expression inside the parentheses immediately.
