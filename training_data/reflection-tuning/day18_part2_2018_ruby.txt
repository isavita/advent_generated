To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Parse the input file and create a 2D grid representing the lumber collection area.
2. Implement a function to simulate one minute of changes.
3. Create a function to count the number of wooded acres and lumberyards.
4. For Part 1, simply run the simulation for 10 minutes and calculate the resource value.
5. For Part 2, we need to optimize for 1,000,000,000 minutes. The key insight here is that the pattern will eventually repeat. We can:
   a. Run the simulation until we detect a repeating pattern.
   b. Calculate the cycle length.
   c. Use modular arithmetic to determine the state after 1,000,000,000 minutes without actually simulating all those minutes.
6. Finally, calculate and return the resource value for both parts.
