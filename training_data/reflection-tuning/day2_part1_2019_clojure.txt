To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" as a list of integers.
2. Implement the Intcode computer logic.
3. Modify the input by replacing position 1 with 12 and position 2 with 2.
4. Run the Intcode program until it halts.
5. Return the value at position 0.

We'll create helper functions to:
- Parse the input
- Execute a single opcode
- Run the entire program

The main function will tie everything together, applying the initial modifications and running the program.
