To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to extract seeds and mapping ranges.
2. Create a function to apply a single mapping to a number.
3. Create a function to apply all mappings in sequence to a seed number.
4. Use these functions to find the lowest location number for all initial seeds.

The key to efficiency here is to avoid generating full lists of mapped numbers and instead work with ranges. We'll use Clojure's built-in functions like reduce, map, and apply to keep the code concise and functional.
