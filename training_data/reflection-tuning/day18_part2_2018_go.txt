To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" and create a 2D grid to represent the lumber collection area.
2. Implement a function to simulate one minute of changes according to the given rules.
3. Create a function to count the number of wooded acres and lumberyards.
4. For Part 1, simply run the simulation for 10 minutes and calculate the resource value.
5. For Part 2, we need to optimize for 1,000,000,000 minutes. The key insight is that the pattern will likely repeat after some time. We can detect this cycle and fast-forward to the end state.

To detect the cycle:
- We'll use a map to store the state of the grid after each minute.
- When we encounter a repeated state, we've found the cycle length.
- We can then calculate how many cycles will occur in the remaining time and jump to the equivalent state.

This approach will significantly reduce the computation time for Part 2.
