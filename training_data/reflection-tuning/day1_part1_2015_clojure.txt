To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input from the file "input.txt".
2. Use a reduce function to iterate through each character in the input string.
3. For each '(' character, increment the floor count by 1.
4. For each ')' character, decrement the floor count by 1.
5. Return the final floor count.

This approach allows us to process the input in a single pass, making it efficient for large inputs. We'll use Clojure's built-in functions for file reading and string processing to keep the code concise.
