The error message indicates that there's an issue with concatenating a list and an integer in the explode function. This suggests that the function is not handling the case where 'b' is an integer correctly. The error occurs when trying to add 'right' (which is likely an integer) to 'b[0]', but 'b' itself is an integer in this case.

To fix this, we need to modify the explode function to handle both cases where 'b' can be either a list or an integer. We should check the type of 'b' before attempting to add 'right' to it.

Additionally, the reduce function seems to be using the add function incorrectly. It should be applying the add function to the result and the current number, not passing it as an argument to reduce.

Let's revise the code to address these issues and implement the full solution for the snailfish number addition and magnitude calculation.
