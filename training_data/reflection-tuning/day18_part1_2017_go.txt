To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt"
2. Parse each instruction and store them in a suitable data structure
3. Implement a function to execute the instructions
4. Keep track of the last played sound
5. Stop execution when we encounter a non-zero rcv instruction
6. Return the last played sound as the answer

We'll use a struct to represent each instruction and a map to store register values. We'll implement a function to execute instructions and another to parse the input file.
