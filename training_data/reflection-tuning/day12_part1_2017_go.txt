To solve this problem, we can use a graph representation and perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from program ID 0. Here's the approach:

1. Parse the input file and create an adjacency list to represent the connections between programs.
2. Implement a DFS function to traverse the graph starting from program ID 0.
3. Keep track of visited programs to avoid revisiting them.
4. Count the number of programs reached during the traversal.

This solution is efficient as it only visits each program once, resulting in a time complexity of O(N + E), where N is the number of programs and E is the number of connections.
