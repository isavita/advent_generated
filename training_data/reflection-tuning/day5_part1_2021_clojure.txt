To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read and parse the input file
2. Filter out diagonal lines, keeping only horizontal and vertical lines
3. Generate all points for each line
4. Count the occurrences of each point
5. Count how many points have at least 2 occurrences

We can use Clojure's efficient data structures like sets and maps to handle the point counting. We'll use the `frequencies` function to count point occurrences efficiently.
