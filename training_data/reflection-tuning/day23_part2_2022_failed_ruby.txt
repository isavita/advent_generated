The error message indicates a syntax error on line 57, specifically with the syntax for destructuring an array in a block parameter. In Ruby, when destructuring an array within a block parameter, we don't need to use square brackets. The correct syntax would be to simply use `old_pos` instead of `[old_pos]`. This change should resolve the syntax error and allow the code to run properly.

Additionally, it seems that there might be some missing code between lines 57 and 60, as the error message shows an empty block. We should ensure that the block contains the necessary logic for moving the elves.
