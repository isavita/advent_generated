To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" and parse it into a 2D array.
2. Find the starting point (the first '|' in the top row).
3. Traverse the path, keeping track of:
   - Current position (row, column)
   - Current direction
   - Letters encountered
   - Total steps taken
4. Implement logic to change direction at '+' intersections.
5. Stop when we reach the end of the path (no valid next step).
6. Return the collected letters (Part 1) and total steps (Part 2).

We'll use a simple state machine approach for direction changes and a hash to map directions to coordinate changes.
