To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt"
2. Track Santa's position as he moves
3. Keep a record of unique houses visited
4. Count the number of unique houses at the end

We can use a set to keep track of unique houses visited, as it automatically eliminates duplicates. We'll represent each house as a coordinate pair [x y]. We'll use reduce to iterate through the directions, updating Santa's position and the set of visited houses with each move.
