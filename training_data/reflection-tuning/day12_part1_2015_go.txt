To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the JSON document from the "input.txt" file.
2. Parse the JSON data.
3. Recursively traverse the JSON structure (which can contain nested arrays and objects).
4. Identify and sum up all the numbers encountered during traversal.

We can use Go's encoding/json package to unmarshal the JSON data into a generic interface{}. Then, we'll create a recursive function that handles different types (float64 for numbers, []interface{} for arrays, and map[string]interface{} for objects) and accumulates the sum of all numbers found.
