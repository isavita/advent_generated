To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Read and parse the input file to extract the image enhancement algorithm and the initial image.
2. Implement a function to enhance the image based on the algorithm.
3. Apply the enhancement twice to the initial image.
4. Count the number of lit pixels in the final image.

Key considerations:
- We need to handle the infinite nature of the image by adding a border of dark pixels around the image before each enhancement.
- We should use a Set to store the coordinates of lit pixels for efficient lookup and counting.
- The tricky part is handling the pixels outside the visible area, which will all flip between on and off if the first character of the algorithm is '#' and the last is '.'.
