To solve this problem, we need to implement an assembunny interpreter that can handle the new 'tgl' instruction. Here's the approach:

1. Read and parse the input file.
2. Initialize registers (a, b, c, d) with 'a' set to 7 (the number of eggs).
3. Implement the interpreter with functions for each instruction type (cpy, inc, dec, jnz, tgl).
4. Execute the instructions, keeping track of the program counter.
5. Handle the 'tgl' instruction by modifying the instruction list as specified.
6. After execution, return the value in register 'a'.

The key challenges are implementing the 'tgl' instruction correctly and ensuring that we handle out-of-bounds toggling and invalid instructions properly.
