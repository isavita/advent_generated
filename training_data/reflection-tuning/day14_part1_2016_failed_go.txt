The previous solution likely had an issue with the logic for finding the 64th key. It might have stopped too early or miscounted the valid keys. To fix this, we need to ensure that we're correctly identifying triplets, checking the next 1000 hashes for quintuplets, and accurately counting the number of valid keys found. We should also make sure we're using the correct salt and properly incrementing the index.

Another potential issue could be in the MD5 hash generation or the way we're searching for repeating characters. We need to ensure that we're correctly generating the MD5 hash and efficiently searching for triplets and quintuplets.

To improve the solution, we should:
1. Implement a more efficient way to find triplets and quintuplets in the hash.
2. Correctly track the number of valid keys found.
3. Ensure we're checking the next 1000 hashes for each potential key.
4. Use a proper MD5 hashing function.
5. Implement the logic to continue searching until we find the 64th key.
