The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely too computationally expensive, probably due to inefficient algorithms or unnecessary iterations. To address this, we should focus on optimizing the tile matching and image assembly process. Here are some potential improvements:

1. Use a more efficient data structure to store and match tile edges, such as a hash map.
2. Implement a smarter tile placement algorithm that reduces the number of iterations needed.
3. Optimize the sea monster detection by pre-computing the pattern and using a sliding window approach.
4. Use bitwise operations for tile rotations and flips to improve performance.

Let's implement these optimizations in our revised solution.
