To solve this problem, we need to approach it in two parts:

1. Parse the input file to extract the samples and the test program.
2. Implement all 16 opcodes as functions.
3. For each sample, test which opcodes could produce the observed result.
4. Count how many samples behave like three or more opcodes.
5. Use the samples to deduce which number corresponds to which opcode.
6. Execute the test program using the deduced opcode mappings.

The key to efficiency here is to use sets for quick lookups and a dictionary to store the opcode functions. We'll also use a bit of logic to narrow down the opcode possibilities quickly.
