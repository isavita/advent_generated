To solve this problem efficiently, we can break it down into several steps:

1. Generate the data using the modified dragon curve until we have at least 272 characters.
2. Truncate the data to exactly 272 characters.
3. Calculate the checksum by repeatedly pairing characters and generating a new string until we get an odd length.

For the data generation, we can use string operations and slicing to efficiently create the new string in each step. For the checksum calculation, we can use a loop that continues until we get an odd-length string.

To optimize for larger inputs, we can use string concatenation sparingly and utilize list comprehensions for the checksum calculation.
