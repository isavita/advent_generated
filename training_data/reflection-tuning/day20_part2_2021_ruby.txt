To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse the enhancement algorithm and the initial image.
2. Create a function to enhance the image, which will:
   - Pad the image with a border of dark pixels.
   - Create a new image by applying the enhancement algorithm to each pixel.
   - Handle the infinite nature of the image by tracking the state of the "infinite" pixels.
3. Enhance the image the required number of times (2 for Part 1, 50 for Part 2).
4. Count the number of lit pixels in the final image.

To optimize for efficiency:
- We'll use a Set to store lit pixel coordinates, which provides O(1) lookup and insertion.
- We'll only store coordinates of lit pixels to save memory.
- We'll dynamically expand the image boundaries as needed during enhancement.
