The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely too computationally expensive, especially for large inputs and 100 phases. The main issue is probably in the way the FFT algorithm was implemented. A naive implementation would have a time complexity of O(n^2) per phase, where n is the length of the input, which becomes very slow for large inputs.

To optimize this, we can make use of some mathematical properties of the FFT pattern:

1. The pattern repeats in a predictable way based on the position.
2. There are large sections of zeros in the pattern that we can skip.
3. The last digit of the input is always the same in the output.
4. We can use cumulative sums to speed up calculations for the first half of the digits.

By implementing these optimizations, we can significantly reduce the computation time and avoid the timeout error.
