The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using a brute-force approach, which becomes inefficient for large step counts and infinite grids. To solve this problem efficiently, we need to recognize the pattern in the grid expansion and use mathematical properties to calculate the result without simulating each step.

Key observations:
1. The grid repeats infinitely in all directions.
2. The number of steps (26501365) is very large.
3. The starting point is in the center of the grid.
4. The grid size is likely odd (to have a center point).

Approach:
1. Calculate the size of one grid tile.
2. Determine how many complete grid tiles are covered in each direction.
3. Use the properties of diamond-shaped expansion to calculate the number of plots reached.
4. Account for the partial grids at the edges.
5. Use modular arithmetic to handle the repeating pattern efficiently.

This approach should be much faster than simulating each step, avoiding the timeout issue.
