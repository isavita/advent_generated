The error message suggests that there's an issue with the `explode` function, specifically when trying to add an integer (right) to a list (b). This indicates that the `explode` function is not handling the case where `b` is a list correctly. We need to modify the `explode` function to handle both cases where `b` can be either an integer or a list.

To fix this, we should check the type of `b` before performing the addition. If `b` is a list, we should add the `right` value to the leftmost number in `b`. If `b` is an integer, we can perform the addition as before.

Additionally, we should make sure that the `reduce` function is correctly implemented to handle both explode and split operations, and that the `add` function is properly combining two snailfish numbers.
