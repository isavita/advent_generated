Upon analyzing the previous output, it seems that the solution for Part 1 is correct (250957639). However, the solution for Part 2 is incorrect. The main issue likely lies in the handling of the joker cards (J) in Part 2.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Modify the card ranking for Part 2, making J the weakest card.
2. Implement a function to determine the best possible hand type when J is present, treating it as a wildcard.
3. Adjust the hand type calculation to account for jokers.
4. Ensure that when comparing hands of the same type, J is treated as the weakest card for tie-breaking.

The revised solution should carefully implement these changes while keeping the core logic for hand comparison and sorting intact.
