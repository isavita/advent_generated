The error message indicates that there's a type mismatch in the hexToBin function. It's trying to use a rune (which is an alias for int32 in Go) as a byte. This suggests that the function is likely iterating over a string of hexadecimal characters, but treating each character as a rune instead of a byte.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we're working with bytes instead of runes when converting hexadecimal to binary. We can do this by either converting the rune to a byte explicitly, or by changing how we iterate over the string.

Additionally, the error suggests that the previous solution might have been incomplete or incorrect in other ways. We'll need to implement the full solution, including the knot hash calculation, grid creation, and region counting.
