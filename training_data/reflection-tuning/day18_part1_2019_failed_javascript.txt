The error message indicates that `grid.findIndex` is not a function or its return value is not iterable. This suggests that `grid` might not be an array as expected, but possibly a string or another data type. To fix this, we need to ensure that `grid` is properly parsed into a 2D array before using array methods like `findIndex`.

Additionally, the spread operator `...` is being used incorrectly. Even if `findIndex` worked, it would return a single index, not a pair of coordinates. We need to find both the row and column indices separately.

To address these issues, we should:
1. Ensure `grid` is parsed into a 2D array of characters.
2. Implement a function to find the coordinates of a key or the starting position.
3. Modify the BFS algorithm to work with the 2D grid structure.
