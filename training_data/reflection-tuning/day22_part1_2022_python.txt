To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the map and the path instructions.
2. Implement a function to move on the map according to the instructions.
3. Handle wrapping around the map when reaching edges.
4. Keep track of the current position and facing direction.
5. Calculate the final password based on the ending position and facing.

The approach will be:
- Use a 2D list to represent the map.
- Use a tuple (row, col) to represent the current position.
- Use an integer (0-3) to represent the facing direction.
- Implement a function to move forward and handle wrapping.
- Implement a function to turn left or right.
- Parse and execute the path instructions.
- Calculate and return the final password.
