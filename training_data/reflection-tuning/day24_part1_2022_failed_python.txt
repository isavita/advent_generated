The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using an inefficient algorithm, possibly a brute-force approach that explores all possible paths. To fix this, we need to implement a more efficient pathfinding algorithm, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) with some optimizations.

Key optimizations to consider:
1. Use a set to keep track of visited states (position and time) to avoid revisiting.
2. Implement the blizzard movement efficiently, possibly by pre-calculating blizzard positions for each minute in a cycle.
3. Use a queue for BFS to explore states level by level.
4. Implement early termination when the goal is reached.

The revised solution should be able to handle larger inputs and complex blizzard patterns more efficiently.
