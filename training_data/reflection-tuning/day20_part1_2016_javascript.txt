To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse each line into a range of blocked IPs.
2. Sort these ranges based on their start values.
3. Merge overlapping ranges to simplify our blocked IP list.
4. Iterate through the merged ranges, keeping track of the lowest unblocked IP.
5. Return the first unblocked IP we find.

This approach allows us to handle large ranges of IPs efficiently without having to store or check every individual IP address.
