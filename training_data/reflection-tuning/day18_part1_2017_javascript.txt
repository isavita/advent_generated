To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from the file.
2. Parse each line into an instruction.
3. Implement a function for each instruction type.
4. Create a program execution loop that processes instructions one by one.
5. Keep track of the last played sound.
6. Stop when we encounter a 'rcv' instruction with a non-zero value.
7. Return the last played sound as the answer.

We'll use a Map to store register values, defaulting to 0 for uninitialized registers. We'll also use a separate variable to keep track of the last played sound.
