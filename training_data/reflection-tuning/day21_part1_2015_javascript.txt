To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to get the boss's stats.
2. Define the available items (weapons, armor, and rings).
3. Generate all possible combinations of items (1 weapon, 0-1 armor, 0-2 rings).
4. For each combination, simulate the fight and check if the player wins.
5. Keep track of the minimum gold spent on winning combinations.
6. Return the least amount of gold spent on a winning combination.

We'll use a recursive function to generate all possible item combinations. For each combination, we'll simulate the fight and check if the player wins. We'll keep track of the minimum gold spent on winning combinations.
