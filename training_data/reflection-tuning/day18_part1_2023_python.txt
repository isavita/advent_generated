To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Read the input from the file and parse each line to extract the direction, distance, and color.
2. Calculate the coordinates of each point in the trench as we follow the dig plan.
3. Use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the polygon formed by the trench.
4. Use Pick's theorem to calculate the number of interior points.
5. Add the number of interior points to the number of boundary points to get the total area.

The Shoelace formula will give us the area of the polygon, and Pick's theorem will help us convert this area into the number of integer points inside the polygon. We'll also need to account for the boundary points.

This approach is efficient as it runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of instructions in the dig plan.
