The previous solution likely had an issue with the calculation of the sum of pot numbers containing plants after 20 generations. The error output of 845 suggests that the calculation was incorrect or the simulation wasn't running for the full 20 generations. To fix this, we need to ensure that:

1. The initial state is correctly parsed and represented.
2. The rules for plant growth are properly implemented.
3. The simulation runs for exactly 20 generations.
4. The sum calculation at the end correctly accounts for all pots containing plants, including those with negative indices.

I'll revise the solution to address these potential issues, focusing on a clear implementation of the simulation and a careful calculation of the final sum.
