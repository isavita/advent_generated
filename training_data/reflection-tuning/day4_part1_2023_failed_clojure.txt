The error message indicates that there's a problem with the `clojure.set` namespace not being found. This suggests that the code is trying to use functions from the `clojure.set` namespace without properly requiring it. To fix this issue, we need to add a require statement for `clojure.set` at the beginning of our code. Additionally, we should ensure that we're using the correct syntax for set operations and that our overall logic for calculating the points is correct.
