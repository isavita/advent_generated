The previous solution likely implemented the first part of the problem correctly, as the output 2466603 is close to the expected answer for Part One (1815603). However, the error is that it didn't implement Part Two of the problem, which has different rules for stealing presents.

To fix this, we need to implement the new rules where each Elf steals from the Elf directly across the circle. The key changes would be:

1. Instead of stealing from the Elf to the left, we need to calculate the position of the Elf across the circle.
2. The circle size changes dynamically as Elves are removed, so we need to recalculate the "across" position each time.
3. We should use a data structure that allows for efficient removal of elements from the middle, such as a doubly linked list.

I'll implement a solution using a custom doubly linked list to represent the circle of Elves, which will allow for efficient removal and traversal.
