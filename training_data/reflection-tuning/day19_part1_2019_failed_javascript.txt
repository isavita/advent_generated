The previous solution likely had an issue with properly counting the affected points or with the implementation of the tractor beam logic. The output of 0 suggests that the code might not be correctly identifying the affected points or might be failing to iterate through the entire 50x50 grid. To fix this, we need to ensure that we're correctly implementing the Intcode program for the tractor beam, iterating through all points in the 50x50 grid, and accurately counting the affected points.
