To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse each line into game data.
2. For each game, extract the maximum number of cubes for each color.
3. Calculate the power of each game (product of the maximum cubes for each color).
4. Sum up the powers of all games.

We'll use Clojure's powerful sequence processing functions like `map`, `reduce`, and `apply` to handle the data efficiently. We'll also use regular expressions to parse the input strings.
