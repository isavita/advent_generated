The error message indicates that we're trying to use the modulo operator (%) on a nil value. This suggests that we're attempting to access a register that doesn't exist or hasn't been initialized. The error occurs in the line handling the "jie" instruction.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. All registers are properly initialized at the start of the program.
2. We're correctly accessing the register values in all instructions, especially "jie" and "jio".
3. We handle cases where an instruction might reference a non-existent register.

I'll modify the code to initialize both 'a' and 'b' registers, ensure we're accessing them correctly, and add error checking for invalid register names.
