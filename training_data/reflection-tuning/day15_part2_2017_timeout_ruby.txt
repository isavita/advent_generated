The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, probably due to a naive implementation that generated all pairs and compared them. To fix this, we need to optimize the generation process and the comparison. Here's how we can approach it:

1. Instead of generating all pairs upfront, we can generate values on-the-fly.
2. We can use a more efficient method to generate values that meet the criteria (multiples of 4 for A and 8 for B).
3. We can use bitwise operations for faster comparison of the lowest 16 bits.
4. We can avoid unnecessary calculations by only generating the required number of pairs.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the execution time and prevent timeout issues.
