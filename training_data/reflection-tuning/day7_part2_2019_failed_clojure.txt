The error message indicates that the program is unable to find the clojure.math.combinatorics library. This suggests that the previous solution was trying to use this library for generating combinations, but it wasn't properly included in the project dependencies. To fix this, we need to either add the library to the project's dependencies or implement our own combination function. Since adding dependencies might not be possible in this coding challenge environment, I'll opt for implementing a simple combination function ourselves.

Additionally, we'll need to implement the Intcode computer as described in the problem, and create functions to simulate the amplifier circuit in both normal and feedback loop modes. We'll use recursion for the feedback loop to avoid mutable state.
