To solve this problem, we need to implement several key components:
1. A data structure to represent snailfish numbers (nested pairs)
2. Functions to parse the input and convert it to our data structure
3. Addition operation for snailfish numbers
4. Reduction operations (explode and split)
5. Magnitude calculation
6. A function to find the largest magnitude from adding any two numbers

The main challenges are:
- Implementing the complex reduction rules
- Handling the nested structure of snailfish numbers
- Efficiently performing operations on the numbers

We'll use a binary tree-like structure to represent snailfish numbers, with each node either being a pair (with left and right children) or a regular number. We'll implement methods for addition, explosion, splitting, and magnitude calculation on this structure.

For Part 2, we'll need to try all possible pairs of numbers, which can be done in O(n^2) time where n is the number of snailfish numbers.
