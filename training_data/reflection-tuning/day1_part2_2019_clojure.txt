To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we'll follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse each line as an integer.
2. Define a function to calculate the fuel required for a given mass.
3. Define a recursive function to calculate the total fuel required, including fuel for the fuel.
4. Use these functions to calculate the total fuel for all modules.

For Part 1, we'll simply map the fuel calculation function over all masses and sum the results.
For Part 2, we'll use the recursive function to calculate the total fuel for each module, including fuel for fuel, and then sum all results.

We'll use Clojure's efficient sequence operations and leverage lazy evaluation for performance.
