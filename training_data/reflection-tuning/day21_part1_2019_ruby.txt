To solve this problem, we need to create a springscript program that will allow the springdroid to navigate the hull without falling into space. The key is to create a set of instructions that will make the droid jump over holes while ensuring it lands on solid ground.

Here's the approach:

1. We'll read the Intcode program from the input file.
2. We'll create a springscript program that checks for holes and decides when to jump.
3. We'll send this program to the Intcode computer along with the WALK command.
4. We'll run the Intcode program and interpret its output.

For the springscript program, a good strategy would be:
- Jump if there's a hole in the next three spaces (A, B, or C is false)
- But only if there's ground to land on (D is true)

This can be implemented with the following springscript:

NOT A T
NOT B J
OR T J
NOT C T
OR T J
AND D J

This program will make the droid jump over holes of length 1, 2, or 3, but only if there's ground to land on at position D.

After sending this program and the WALK command, we'll interpret the output. If it's a large number, that's our answer. If it's ASCII output, the droid has fallen and we'd need to adjust our program (but we'll assume our program works for this solution).
