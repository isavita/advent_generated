The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, probably due to unnecessary calculations or a suboptimal algorithm. For this type of problem, which involves pathfinding in a grid with changing conditions, a more efficient approach would be to use a priority queue-based algorithm like A* or Dijkstra's algorithm.

To optimize the solution, we should:
1. Pre-calculate and cache the erosion levels for all relevant grid positions to avoid redundant calculations.
2. Use a priority queue for the pathfinding algorithm to ensure we're always exploring the most promising paths first.
3. Implement an efficient heuristic function for the A* algorithm to guide the search towards the target.
4. Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid revisiting the same position with the same equipment.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the execution time and solve the timeout issue.
