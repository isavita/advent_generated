To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file and parse it into two parts: the instructions and the node map.
2. Create a function that follows the instructions and navigates through the node map.
3. Start from 'AAA' and keep following the instructions until we reach 'ZZZ'.
4. Count the number of steps taken.

We can use a loop-recur construct to efficiently iterate through the instructions, wrapping around when we reach the end. We'll use a map to store the node connections for quick lookup.
