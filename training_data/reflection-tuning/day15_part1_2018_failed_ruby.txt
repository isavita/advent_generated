The previous solution likely had an issue with the combat simulation logic. The error output of 22308 suggests that the calculation of the outcome was incorrect. This could be due to several reasons:

1. Incorrect round counting: The simulation might have ended prematurely or continued for too long.
2. Incorrect hit point calculation: The sum of remaining hit points at the end of combat might be wrong.
3. Movement or attack logic errors: Units might not be moving or attacking according to the specified rules.
4. Reading order implementation: The reading order for unit turns or tie-breaking might be incorrectly implemented.

To fix this, we need to carefully implement each step of the combat simulation, ensuring that:
- Units move and attack in the correct order
- The pathfinding algorithm for movement is correct
- The attack logic follows the specified rules
- The round counting is accurate
- The final calculation of outcome is correct

I'll provide a revised solution that attempts to address these potential issues.
