The error message indicates a RecursionError, which means the DFS function is calling itself too many times and exceeding the maximum recursion depth. This typically happens when the function doesn't have a proper base case or when the graph is too large or complex for a recursive approach.

To fix this issue, we can:

1. Implement an iterative DFS using a stack instead of recursion. This will avoid the recursion depth limit.
2. Optimize the visited set handling to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
3. Implement a more efficient way to find the start and end positions.
4. Use a single function for both parts of the problem, with a parameter to determine whether slopes should be treated as normal paths.

These changes should resolve the recursion error and make the solution more efficient.
