To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input from the file and parse it into a list of integers.
2. Calculate the range of possible positions (min to max of input).
3. For each position in the range, calculate the total fuel cost for all crabs to move to that position.
4. Find the minimum fuel cost among all calculated positions.

For Part 2, we need to modify the fuel cost calculation. Instead of a linear cost, we use a triangular number series (1+2+3+...+n). We can optimize this calculation using the formula n*(n+1)/2.

To make the solution more efficient, we can:
1. Use Clojure's built-in functions like `map`, `reduce`, and `apply` for concise and performant operations.
2. Memoize the triangular number calculation to avoid redundant computations.
3. Use `range` to generate possible positions instead of explicitly creating a list.

This approach should provide a balance between readability and performance.
