To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the package weights from the input file.
2. Calculate the total weight and divide it by 3 to get the target weight for each group.
3. Use a recursive function to find all possible combinations of packages that sum up to the target weight.
4. Sort these combinations by length (number of packages) and then by quantum entanglement.
5. Return the quantum entanglement of the first (optimal) combination.

To optimize the solution:
- We'll use itertools.combinations to generate package combinations efficiently.
- We'll use early stopping in our recursive function to avoid unnecessary computations.
- We'll cache the results of our recursive function to avoid redundant calculations.
