The error message suggests that the program is trying to parse a string "0B0BB0BRR0" as a binary number, which is causing a NumberFormatException. This indicates that the code is likely trying to convert the boarding pass string directly to a number, which is incorrect. Instead, we need to implement the binary space partitioning logic described in the problem.

To fix this, we should:
1. Implement a function to convert the F/B and L/R characters to binary (0/1).
2. Split the boarding pass into row and column parts.
3. Convert these binary strings to decimal numbers.
4. Calculate the seat ID as described in the problem.
5. Find the highest seat ID for part 1.
6. For part 2, find the missing seat ID that's not at the very front or back.
