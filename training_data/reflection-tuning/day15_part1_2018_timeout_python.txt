The previous solution likely had an issue with the combat simulation logic. The incorrect output of 187020 suggests that either the number of rounds or the total hit points remaining at the end of combat were calculated incorrectly. 

To fix this, we need to ensure:
1. The combat simulation accurately follows the rules for movement and attack.
2. The round counting is correct and stops when no more valid targets are available.
3. The hit point calculation at the end of combat is accurate.
4. The final outcome multiplication (rounds * total hit points) is performed correctly.

I'll revise the solution, focusing on these aspects and implementing a more robust combat simulation system.
