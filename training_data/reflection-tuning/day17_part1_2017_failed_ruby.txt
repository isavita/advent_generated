The previous solution likely produced the incorrect output of 1447 because it might have been tracking the wrong position or not correctly updating the circular buffer. The key to solving this problem is to accurately simulate the spinlock's behavior, keeping track of the current position and inserting new values at the correct locations.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. We're correctly stepping through the buffer
2. We're inserting new values at the right position
3. We're updating the current position after each insertion
4. We're correctly identifying the value after 2017 in the final buffer

Instead of actually maintaining a full buffer (which could be memory-intensive), we can optimize by only keeping track of the current position and the value after 0. This is because we only need to know the value after 2017 in the end, and 2017 will always be inserted after 0 is passed.
