The error message indicates that the module 'big-integer' cannot be found. This suggests that the previous solution was trying to use a big integer library to handle the large numbers in Part Two of the problem. However, this library is not a built-in module in Node.js and needs to be installed separately.

To fix this issue, we have two options:
1. Install the 'big-integer' library (which might not be possible in the given environment)
2. Implement our own solution using JavaScript's built-in BigInt type, which can handle arbitrarily large integers

I'll choose the second option as it doesn't require any external dependencies and will work in most JavaScript environments. We'll use BigInt for all calculations to handle the large numbers in Part Two.

The solution will involve implementing the shuffle operations and then using modular arithmetic to efficiently calculate the result after many shuffles.
