To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file line by line.
2. For each line, create a method to check if it's a nice string based on the given criteria.
3. Use regular expressions to simplify the checks for vowels, double letters, and forbidden substrings.
4. Keep a count of nice strings and increment it for each nice string found.
5. Finally, print the total count of nice strings.

The use of regular expressions will make our code more concise and efficient, as they are optimized for pattern matching in strings.
