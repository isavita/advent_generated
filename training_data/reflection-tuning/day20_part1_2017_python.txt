To solve this problem, we need to consider the long-term behavior of the particles. The key insight is that the acceleration determines the long-term trajectory of each particle. Particles with the smallest acceleration magnitude will eventually be closest to the origin.

Here's the approach:
1. Parse the input file to extract particle information.
2. For each particle, calculate the magnitude of its acceleration (sum of absolute values of ax, ay, az).
3. Find the particle(s) with the smallest acceleration magnitude.
4. If there's a tie in acceleration, compare velocities, then positions.
5. Return the index of the particle that will stay closest to <0,0,0> in the long term.

This approach is efficient because it doesn't require simulating the particles' movements over time. Instead, it uses the initial conditions to determine the long-term behavior.
