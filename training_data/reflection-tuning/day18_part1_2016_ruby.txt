To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the initial row from the input file.
2. Create a function to generate the next row based on the current row.
3. Keep track of the total safe tiles as we generate each new row.
4. Repeat the process for 40 rows (including the initial row).

The key to efficiency here is to avoid storing all rows in memory. Instead, we'll generate each row based on the previous one and only keep track of the count of safe tiles. This approach will have a time complexity of O(n*m) where n is the number of rows and m is the length of each row, and a space complexity of O(m) as we only store one row at a time.
