To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read and parse the input file, converting each line into a vector of coordinates.
2. Create a function to generate all points on a line (including diagonal lines for Part Two).
3. Use a reduce function to accumulate all points from all lines into a frequency map.
4. Count the number of points where the frequency is 2 or more.

For efficiency, we'll use Clojure's persistent data structures and avoid unnecessary intermediate collections. We'll also use transient collections inside the reduce function for better performance when accumulating large numbers of points.
