To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the instructions from the input file.
2. Implement a function for each instruction (hlf, tpl, inc, jmp, jie, jio).
3. Create a program execution function that processes the instructions.
4. Keep track of the current instruction index and register values.
5. Execute instructions until we try to access an instruction beyond the list.
6. Return the final value of register b.

The approach will be to use a dictionary to store register values and a list to store instructions. We'll use a while loop to execute instructions, updating the instruction index based on jumps and other operations.
