To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the initial state, number of steps, and state rules.
2. Implement a Turing machine simulation using a dictionary to represent the tape (for efficiency with sparse data).
3. Run the simulation for the specified number of steps.
4. Count the number of 1s on the tape after the simulation.

The key to efficiency here is using a dictionary for the tape, as it allows us to only store the positions that have been changed to 1, saving memory and improving performance for large numbers of steps.
