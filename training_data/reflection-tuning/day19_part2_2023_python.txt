The error message indicates that the regular expression in the parse_workflows function is failing to match some lines in the input. This could be because the input format is slightly different from what we expected, or there might be empty lines or other unexpected content in the input file. To fix this, we should make our parsing more robust by:

1. Skipping empty lines
2. Using a more flexible regular expression that can handle variations in the input format
3. Adding error handling to gracefully skip lines that don't match the expected format

Additionally, we should separate the parsing of workflows and parts to handle the blank line between them more effectively.
