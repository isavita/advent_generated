Based on the given output, it seems that the previous solution correctly solved Part 1 (299 minutes), but the result for Part 2 (848 minutes) is likely incorrect. The issue might be in the implementation of the round-trip calculation for Part 2.

To fix this, we should ensure that:
1. After reaching the goal in Part 1, we reset the starting position to the goal and set the new goal as the original starting position.
2. After reaching the original starting position, we again reset the starting position and set the goal back to the original goal.
3. We need to continue the blizzard movement from where it left off after Part 1, not reset it.
4. We should accumulate the total time for all three trips.

I'll provide a revised solution that addresses these points and should correctly solve both parts of the problem.
