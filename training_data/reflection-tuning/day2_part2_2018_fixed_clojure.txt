The error message indicates that the program is unable to find the clojure.math.combinatorics library. This suggests that the previous solution was likely trying to use this library for generating combinations, but it wasn't properly included in the project dependencies.

To fix this, we have two options:
1. Add the necessary dependency to the project.clj file (if using Leiningen) or deps.edn (if using Clojure CLI tools).
2. Implement the solution without relying on the combinatorics library.

Given that the problem doesn't necessarily require complex combinatorics operations, I'll opt for the second approach. We can solve this problem using basic Clojure functions without external libraries.

For part 1, we'll use frequencies to count letter occurrences in each ID, then filter and count IDs with exactly 2 and 3 of any letter.

For part 2, we'll compare each ID with every other ID, checking for exactly one character difference. We can do this efficiently using map and keep functions.
