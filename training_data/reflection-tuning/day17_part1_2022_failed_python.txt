To solve this problem, we need to simulate the falling rocks and jet patterns. Here's the approach:

1. Parse the input to get the jet pattern.
2. Define the rock shapes.
3. Implement a function to simulate the falling of a single rock.
4. Keep track of the tower's height and the current state of the chamber.
5. Simulate 2022 rocks falling.
6. Return the final height of the tower.

Key optimizations:
- Use a set to store occupied positions in the chamber for quick collision checks.
- Only keep track of the top portion of the chamber that's relevant for future collisions.
- Use modulo operations to cycle through rock shapes and jet patterns.
