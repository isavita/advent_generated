To solve this problem, we need to create a springscript program that will allow the springdroid to navigate the hull without falling into space. The key is to create a set of instructions that will make the droid jump over holes while ensuring it lands on solid ground.

For Part 1, we can use the following logic:
1. Jump if there's a hole in the next three tiles (A, B, or C is false)
2. But only if there's ground to land on (D is true)

For Part 2, we need to extend this logic to account for the additional sensors:
1. Jump if there's a hole in the next four tiles (A, B, C, or D is false)
2. But only if there's ground to land on (E is true)
3. Or if there's a hole at E but ground at H (to handle longer jumps)

We'll implement this logic using springscript instructions, then feed these instructions to the Intcode program. We'll use the IntcodeComputer class from previous days to run the Intcode program.
