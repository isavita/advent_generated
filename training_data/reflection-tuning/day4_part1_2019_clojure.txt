To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the range from the input file.
2. Generate a sequence of numbers within that range.
3. Filter the sequence based on the given criteria:
   - Check if the number has at least one pair of adjacent identical digits.
   - Ensure the digits are non-decreasing from left to right.
4. Count the number of valid passwords.

To optimize the solution:
- We can use lazy sequences to avoid generating all numbers at once.
- We can convert numbers to strings for easier digit comparison.
- We can use short-circuiting logic to quickly discard invalid numbers.
