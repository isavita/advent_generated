The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using an inefficient algorithm, possibly a brute-force approach or a poorly optimized search algorithm. To fix this, we need to implement a more efficient solution. 

For this type of problem, a good approach would be to use a breadth-first search (BFS) with some optimizations:

1. Use a priority queue to always explore the most promising paths first.
2. Implement a state caching mechanism to avoid revisiting the same states.
3. Use bitwise operations to efficiently represent and manipulate the set of collected keys.
4. Precompute distances between important points (keys and entrances) to avoid redundant pathfinding.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the search space and improve the execution time.
