To solve this problem, we need to create a springscript program that will allow the springdroid to navigate the hull without falling into space. The key is to create a set of instructions that will make the droid jump at the right moments.

For Part 1, we need to consider the following:
1. The droid should jump if there's a hole in front of it (NOT A).
2. It should also jump if there's a hole two or three steps ahead, but ground four steps ahead (NOT B AND NOT C AND D).
3. We need to combine these conditions using OR.

For Part 2, we need to extend our logic to consider the additional sensors E, F, G, H, and I. We can improve our jumping strategy by:
1. Jumping if there's a hole ahead but land to jump to (NOT A AND D).
2. Jumping if there's a hole two steps ahead but land to jump to (NOT B AND D).
3. Jumping if there's a hole three steps ahead but land to jump to (NOT C AND D AND H).
4. We'll combine these conditions using OR.

We'll implement an Intcode computer to run the springscript, read the input, and process the output.
