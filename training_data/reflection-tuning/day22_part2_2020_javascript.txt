To solve this problem, we need to implement both the regular Combat game and the Recursive Combat game. Here's the approach:

1. Parse the input file to get the initial decks for both players.
2. Implement the regular Combat game for Part 1.
3. Implement the Recursive Combat game for Part 2, which includes:
   - Checking for repeated configurations to prevent infinite games.
   - Recursively playing sub-games when conditions are met.
4. Calculate the score of the winning player's deck.

We'll use a Queue data structure to represent the decks, which allows for efficient adding and removing of cards. We'll also use a Set to keep track of previous configurations in the Recursive Combat game.

The solution will include functions for both parts of the problem, allowing us to reuse code and easily calculate both answers.
