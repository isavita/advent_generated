To solve this problem, we need to implement the Knot Hash algorithm as described. Here's the approach:

1. Initialize a list of numbers from 0 to 255.
2. Parse the input file to get the sequence of lengths.
3. Implement the knot hash algorithm:
   - For each length in the sequence:
     a. Reverse the sublist of the specified length.
     b. Move the current position forward.
     c. Increase the skip size.
4. After processing all lengths, multiply the first two numbers in the list.

We'll use a circular list implementation by using modulo arithmetic when accessing elements. This will handle wrapping around the list efficiently.
