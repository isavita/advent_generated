To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract information about each reindeer.
2. Simulate the race for 2503 seconds.
3. Calculate the distance traveled by each reindeer.
4. Find the maximum distance traveled.

We can create a Reindeer class to encapsulate the properties and behavior of each reindeer. The main program will read the input, create Reindeer objects, simulate the race, and find the winner.

To calculate the distance efficiently, we can:
- Determine how many full cycles (flying + resting) fit within 2503 seconds.
- Calculate the distance covered in full cycles.
- Add the distance covered in the remaining time.

This approach avoids simulating each second individually, making it more efficient for larger time periods.
