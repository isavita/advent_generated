The previous solution likely didn't account for the changes in rules 8 and 11 for Part Two of the problem. The main issue is that these rules now contain loops, which makes the matching process more complex. The solution needs to be updated to handle these recursive rules correctly.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Implement a recursive matching function that can handle the looping rules.
2. Update the parsing of rules to recognize the special cases for rules 8 and 11.
3. Modify the main logic to apply the updated rules correctly.

The incorrect output of 175 suggests that the solution might have been counting matches incorrectly or not properly implementing the recursive nature of the new rules.
