To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to separate rules and messages.
2. Create a hash to store the rules, with rule numbers as keys and their definitions as values.
3. Implement a recursive function to match messages against rules.
4. Use memoization to optimize the recursive function and avoid redundant calculations.
5. Count the number of messages that completely match rule 0.

The key to efficiency here is using memoization in the recursive matching function. This will prevent recalculating the same sub-rules multiple times, especially for complex rule structures.
