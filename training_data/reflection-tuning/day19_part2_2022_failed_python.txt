The error message indicates that we're trying to access an index that doesn't exist in the blueprint tuple. This suggests that the blueprint data structure might not have the expected number of elements. The error occurs when trying to access `blueprint[6]`, which implies that we're expecting at least 7 elements in each blueprint, but at least one blueprint has fewer elements.

To fix this, we need to ensure that our blueprint parsing is correct and that we're not assuming a fixed number of elements for each blueprint. We should modify our code to handle blueprints with varying numbers of elements, or ensure that all blueprints have the expected number of elements during parsing.

Let's revise the code to handle this issue by modifying the blueprint parsing and the solve function to work with the actual structure of the blueprints.
