To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input rules into a map for quick lookup.
2. Implement a function to split the grid into smaller squares (2x2 or 3x3).
3. Implement a function to enhance each small square using the rules.
4. Implement a function to join the enhanced squares back into a larger grid.
5. Create a main loop to iterate the process for the required number of times.
6. Count the number of '#' pixels after the iterations.

For efficiency:
- Use a Set to store active pixels instead of a 2D array.
- Precompute all possible rotations and flips for each rule to avoid runtime transformations.
- Use a hash function to quickly match patterns to rules.
