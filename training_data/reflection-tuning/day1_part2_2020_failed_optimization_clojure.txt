The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using a naive approach with nested loops, which can be very inefficient for large inputs. To optimize this, we can use a more efficient algorithm. For part 1, we can use a set for faster lookups. For part 2, we can sort the list first and use a two-pointer approach for each number, which reduces the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2 log n).
