To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that increments the password and checks if it meets all the requirements. Here's the approach:

1. Create a function to increment the password, handling the wrapping of 'z' to 'a'.
2. Implement functions to check each requirement:
   - Increasing straight of at least three letters
   - No 'i', 'o', or 'l'
   - At least two different, non-overlapping pairs
3. Create a main function that reads the input, finds the next valid password, and then finds the next valid password after that for part two.

The solution will use a loop to keep incrementing the password until all requirements are met. We'll use byte manipulation for efficiency when incrementing the password.
