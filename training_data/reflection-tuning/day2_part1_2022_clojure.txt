To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file line by line.
2. For each line, parse the opponent's move and our move.
3. Calculate the score for each round based on the shape we chose and the outcome.
4. Sum up all the scores.

We'll use a map to store the scores for each shape and outcome. We'll also create a function to determine the outcome of each round. By using Clojure's built-in functions like `slurp`, `line-seq`, and `reduce`, we can create a concise and efficient solution.
