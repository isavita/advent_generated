The previous solution likely had an issue with the logic for determining which bricks can be safely disintegrated. The incorrect output of 373 suggests that the algorithm might be overcounting or undercounting the number of bricks that can be safely removed.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. We correctly simulate the falling of bricks to their final positions.
2. We accurately check which bricks are supporting others.
3. We properly determine if removing a brick would cause any other bricks to fall.

The solution should involve:
- Parsing the input and creating a 3D grid to represent the space.
- Simulating the falling of bricks to their final positions.
- Creating a support structure to know which bricks are supporting which others.
- Checking each brick to see if its removal would cause any other bricks to fall.
- Counting the number of bricks that can be safely removed.

Let's implement a more robust solution that addresses these points.
