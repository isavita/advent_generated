The error message indicates that the program is unable to find the module './intcodeComputer'. This suggests that the previous solution was trying to import a separate module for the Intcode computer, but this module doesn't exist in the current directory. To fix this, we need to implement the Intcode computer directly in our main script instead of trying to import it. We'll also need to implement the springdroid logic and the ASCII input/output handling within the same file.
