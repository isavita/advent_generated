To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read and parse the input file to get the initial decks for both players.
2. Implement the game logic, playing rounds until one player has all the cards.
3. Calculate the score of the winning player.

We can use arrays to represent the decks and simulate the game by popping cards from the front and pushing them to the back. The game continues until one player's deck is empty. After the game, we calculate the score by reversing the winning deck and summing up the products of each card with its position.
