To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider two key points:

1. For Part One, we can simulate the spinlock process directly, as the number of iterations (2017) is relatively small.

2. For Part Two, simulating 50 million insertions would be too slow. However, we only need to track the value that comes after 0. We can observe that 0 always stays at the beginning of the buffer, so we only need to keep track of when a new value is inserted at position 1.

For Part One, we'll use an array to represent the circular buffer and simulate the process as described.

For Part Two, we'll use a single variable to keep track of the value after 0, updating it only when a new value would be inserted at position 1.

This approach will be much more efficient for Part Two, as we don't need to store or manipulate a large buffer.
