The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to simulating each button press individually for a large number of presses. To fix this, we need to optimize the solution. Here are some potential optimizations:

1. Instead of simulating 1000 button presses individually, we can look for a cycle in the system's state. Once we find a repeating state, we can calculate the result for 1000 presses without actually simulating all of them.

2. We can use more efficient data structures, like collections.deque for the queue of pulses, and use sets for faster lookups where appropriate.

3. We can optimize the pulse propagation logic to avoid unnecessary operations.

4. For Part Two, instead of simulating button presses until we get a low pulse to 'rx', we can analyze the structure of the circuit to find the conditions that would lead to a low pulse being sent to 'rx'.

Let's implement these optimizations in the revised solution.
