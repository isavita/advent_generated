The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to simulating each button press individually for a large number of presses. To fix this, we need to optimize the solution. Instead of simulating 1000 button presses (or potentially many more for Part Two), we should look for patterns or cycles in the system's behavior.

For Part One, we can simulate a smaller number of button presses (e.g., 100) and check if there's a repeating pattern. If we find a cycle, we can extrapolate the results to 1000 presses without actually simulating them all.

For Part Two, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the cycles of the modules that feed into the 'rx' module. This approach assumes that the input is designed with a cyclical nature, which is often the case in such puzzles.

Here's how we can approach this:
1. Implement the simulation for a single button press.
2. For Part One, run the simulation for a reasonable number of presses, looking for a cycle.
3. For Part Two, identify the modules feeding into 'rx' and track their cycles separately.
4. Use the LCM of these cycles to determine the answer for Part Two.

This approach should be much more efficient and avoid timeout issues.
