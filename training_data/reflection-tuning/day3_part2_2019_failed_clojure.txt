The error message suggests that there's an issue with a vector argument being passed to a map conj operation. This typically occurs when we're trying to add a key-value pair to a map, but the vector doesn't contain exactly two elements (a key and a value). 

The error is occurring in the `trace-wire` function at line 30. It's likely that we're trying to update a map with coordinates, but the coordinate pair is not properly formatted. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that whenever we're adding a new point to our map of visited points, we're using a proper key-value pair. The key should be the coordinate (as a vector), and the value could be the number of steps taken to reach that point.

I'll revise the code to ensure that all map operations are using proper key-value pairs, and I'll also restructure the solution to more clearly separate the wire tracing and intersection finding logic.
