To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" and parse it into a map of depth to range.
2. Simulate the packet's journey through the firewall.
3. For each layer, check if the packet is caught by calculating if the scanner is at the top position when the packet enters.
4. If caught, add the severity (depth * range) to the total.
5. Return the total severity.

The key insight is that we don't need to actually simulate the scanner movement. We can determine if a scanner is at the top position at any given time using modulo arithmetic. A scanner with range R will be at the top position every 2*(R-1) picoseconds.
