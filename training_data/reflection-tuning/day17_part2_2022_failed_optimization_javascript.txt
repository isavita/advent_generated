The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely too slow for handling such a large number of rocks (1000000000000) in Part Two. To address this, we need to implement a more efficient algorithm that can detect patterns in the rock tower's growth.

The key insight is that the rock shapes and jet patterns repeat cyclically. This means that after a certain number of rocks, the tower's growth pattern will start repeating. If we can detect this cycle, we can extrapolate the tower's height for a large number of rocks without simulating each rock individually.

Here's the approach I would take:
1. Implement the simulation for a smaller number of rocks (e.g., the first 10000).
2. For each rock, store a state that includes the current rock index, jet pattern index, and the shape of the top of the tower.
3. Detect when we've seen a state before, which indicates the start of a cycle.
4. Calculate the height gained and the number of rocks dropped in one cycle.
5. Use this information to extrapolate the height for 1000000000000 rocks.

This approach should significantly reduce the computation time and avoid the timeout error.
