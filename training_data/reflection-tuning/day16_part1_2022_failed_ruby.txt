To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) with memoization. Here's the approach:

1. Parse the input to create a graph of valves and their connections.
2. Create a bitmask to represent opened valves for efficient state tracking.
3. Implement a DFS function that explores all possible paths, opening valves and moving between them.
4. Use memoization to avoid recalculating states we've already seen.
5. Keep track of the maximum pressure released during the search.

The key optimizations are:
- Using bitmasks for opened valves to reduce memory usage and improve comparison speed.
- Memoizing states to avoid redundant calculations.
- Pruning paths that can't possibly beat the current best solution.

This approach should provide a good balance between efficiency and simplicity for this complex problem.
