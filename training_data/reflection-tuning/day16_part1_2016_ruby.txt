To solve this problem efficiently, we can break it down into several steps:

1. Generate the data using the modified dragon curve until we have at least 272 characters.
2. Truncate the data to exactly 272 characters.
3. Calculate the checksum by repeatedly pairing characters and generating a new string until we get an odd length.

For the data generation, we can use string manipulation and reversal. For the checksum calculation, we can use a loop that continues until we get an odd-length string.

To make the solution more efficient:
- We'll use string interpolation for faster string concatenation.
- We'll use in-place string reversal and character replacement where possible.
- We'll use a while loop for the checksum calculation to avoid unnecessary array creation.

Let's implement this solution:
