To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the secret key from the input file.
2. Implement a function to calculate MD5 hashes.
3. Iterate through positive numbers, starting from 1.
4. For each number, combine it with the secret key and calculate the MD5 hash.
5. Check if the hash starts with at least five zeroes.
6. Return the lowest number that satisfies the condition.

To make the solution efficient:
- We'll use Ruby's built-in Digest::MD5 library for fast MD5 hash calculation.
- We'll use string interpolation to combine the secret key and number efficiently.
- We'll convert the MD5 digest to hexadecimal and check only the first 5 characters to avoid unnecessary string operations.
