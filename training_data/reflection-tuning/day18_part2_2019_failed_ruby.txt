The error message "-1" typically indicates that the algorithm failed to find a valid solution or path. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The algorithm might not be handling all possible scenarios, especially in the case of multiple robots.
2. There might be an issue with the way we're tracking visited states or managing the queue in a breadth-first search.
3. The implementation might not be correctly handling the case where keys are collected by different robots.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Implement a more robust state representation that includes the positions of all robots and the keys collected.
2. Use a priority queue (min-heap) instead of a regular queue to always explore the most promising states first.
3. Ensure we're correctly handling the collection of keys by any robot and the unlocking of doors.
4. Implement a more efficient way to check if all keys have been collected.

Let's revise the solution with these improvements in mind.
