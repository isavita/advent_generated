The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to a brute-force approach or unnecessary repetitive calculations. To address this, we need to optimize the algorithm. Here are some potential improvements:

1. Use a more efficient data structure for storing and comparing beacon positions, such as a map or a set.
2. Implement a more efficient algorithm for finding overlapping scanners, possibly using hashing or spatial indexing.
3. Optimize the rotation calculations by pre-computing all possible rotations.
4. Use goroutines to parallelize the scanner matching process.
5. Implement early termination conditions when finding matches between scanners.

With these optimizations in mind, I'll provide a revised solution that should be more efficient and avoid the timeout issue.
