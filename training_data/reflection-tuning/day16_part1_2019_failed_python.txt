The previous solution likely had an issue with the implementation of the FFT algorithm. The output "82519348" suggests that the algorithm might have been applied incorrectly or not for the full 100 phases. The main issues to address would be:

1. Ensuring the pattern is correctly generated for each output element.
2. Applying the FFT algorithm for the full 100 phases.
3. Handling large input sizes efficiently.
4. Correctly extracting the first eight digits of the final output.

To fix these issues, we need to implement the FFT algorithm accurately, use efficient data structures (like NumPy arrays for large inputs), and ensure we're running it for the full 100 phases before extracting the result.
