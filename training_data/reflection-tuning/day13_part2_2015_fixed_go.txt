The error message "panic: assignment to entry in nil map" suggests that we're trying to assign a value to a map that hasn't been initialized. This is a common mistake in Go when working with maps. To fix this, we need to ensure that all maps are properly initialized before we use them.

In the context of this problem, it's likely that we're using a map to store happiness values between pairs of people. The error occurs because we're trying to add values to this map before initializing it.

To fix this, we should initialize the map at the beginning of our main function or wherever we first declare it. We'll use make() to create the map before we start assigning values to it.

Additionally, we should consider using a nested map structure to represent the happiness relationships between people, as this problem involves bidirectional relationships between pairs of people.
