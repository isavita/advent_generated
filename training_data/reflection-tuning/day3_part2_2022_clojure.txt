To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the input file line by line.
2. For Part 1:
   - Split each line into two halves (compartments).
   - Find the common character between the two compartments.
   - Calculate the priority of the common item.
   - Sum up all priorities.
3. For Part 2:
   - Group the lines into sets of three.
   - Find the common character among all three lines in each group.
   - Calculate the priority of the common item.
   - Sum up all priorities.
4. We'll create a helper function to calculate the priority of a character.
5. Use efficient Clojure functions like reduce, map, and set operations for better performance.

The solution will use Clojure's built-in functions for file reading, string manipulation, and set operations to solve both parts of the problem concisely and efficiently.
