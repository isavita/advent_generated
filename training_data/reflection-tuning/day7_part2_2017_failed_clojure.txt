The error message indicates that there's a problem with the `clojure.set` namespace not being found. This suggests that the code is trying to use functions from `clojure.set` without properly requiring it. To fix this, we need to add a require statement for `clojure.set` at the beginning of the file. Additionally, we should ensure that all necessary functions are defined and that the logic for finding the unbalanced program and calculating its correct weight is implemented correctly.
