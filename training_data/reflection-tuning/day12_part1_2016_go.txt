To solve this problem, we need to implement a simple assembunny interpreter. We'll create a struct to represent the computer's state, including its registers and the current instruction pointer. We'll then implement functions for each instruction type (cpy, inc, dec, jnz) and a main execution loop that processes the instructions until we reach the end of the program.

The approach will be:
1. Read and parse the input file into a slice of instructions.
2. Initialize the computer state with all registers set to 0.
3. Execute the instructions one by one, updating the registers and instruction pointer accordingly.
4. After the program halts, return the value in register 'a'.

This solution will be efficient as it directly simulates the assembunny code without any unnecessary operations.
