The error message indicates that the program is unable to find the module './intcode'. This suggests that the previous solution was trying to import a module named 'intcode' from the same directory, but this module doesn't exist or isn't in the correct location.

To fix this issue, we need to implement the Intcode computer functionality within our main script instead of trying to import it. We'll need to create functions to handle the Intcode program execution, including input and output operations.

Additionally, we need to implement the tractor beam simulation logic and the search for the 100x100 square. We'll create separate functions for each part of the problem to keep the code organized.
