To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file line by line
2. Keep track of the current bitmask
3. Apply the bitmask to values before writing them to memory
4. Sum all values in memory at the end

We can use a hash to represent memory, where the keys are memory addresses and the values are the masked values. For the bitmask, we'll create two integers: one for the bits to be set (1s) and one for the bits to be cleared (0s). This way, we can efficiently apply the mask using bitwise operations.

The algorithm will be:
1. Initialize an empty hash for memory and set initial mask values
2. For each line in the input:
   - If it's a mask, update the mask values
   - If it's a memory operation, apply the mask and store the result
3. Sum all values in memory and return the result

This approach is efficient as it uses bitwise operations and minimizes string manipulations.
