To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the initial configuration from the input file.
2. Create a function to count the number of active neighbors for each cell.
3. Implement the rules for updating the grid in each step.
4. Create separate functions for Part 1 and Part 2, as they have slightly different rules.
5. Run the simulation for 100 steps and count the number of lights on at the end.

For Part 2, we'll modify the update function to always keep the corner lights on.

To optimize performance, we can use a 2D list to represent the grid and use list comprehensions for efficient grid updates.
