To solve this problem, we need to simulate the Elves' movement process. Here's my approach:

1. Parse the input to create a set of Elf positions.
2. Implement the movement rules as described.
3. For Part 1, simulate 10 rounds and calculate the empty ground tiles.
4. For Part 2, continue simulating until no Elf moves.

Key points:
- Use a set to store Elf positions for efficient lookup.
- Implement a function to check adjacent positions.
- Use a dictionary to track proposed moves and handle conflicts.
- Keep track of the current direction order.

The solution will iterate through the rounds, applying the rules and updating the Elf positions. We'll use helper functions to make the code more readable and maintainable.
