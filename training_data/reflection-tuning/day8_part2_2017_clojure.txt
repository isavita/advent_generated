To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file line by line
2. Parse each instruction into its components (register, operation, value, condition)
3. Maintain a map of register values
4. Evaluate the condition for each instruction
5. If the condition is true, perform the operation on the specified register
6. Keep track of the maximum value ever held in any register
7. After processing all instructions, find the maximum value in any register
8. Return both the maximum value after all instructions and the maximum value ever held

We can use Clojure's built-in functions like slurp, split-lines, and re-matches for parsing. 
We'll use an atom to keep track of the register values and another atom for the maximum value ever held.
