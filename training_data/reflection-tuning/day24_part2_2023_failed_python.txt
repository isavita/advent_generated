The error message indicates that the 'z3' module is not found. This suggests that the previous solution was attempting to use the Z3 theorem prover, which is not a standard Python library. The issue is likely that Z3 is not installed in the environment where the code is being run. To fix this, we need to approach the problem without relying on Z3. Instead, we can implement a solution using standard Python libraries and mathematical calculations to determine intersections and solve the puzzle.

For Part 1, we can implement a function to calculate intersections between hailstone paths in 2D space (ignoring Z-axis). For Part 2, we'll need a more complex approach, possibly using a system of equations or a numerical method to find the initial position and velocity of the rock.
