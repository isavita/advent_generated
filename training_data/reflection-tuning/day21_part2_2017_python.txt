To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input rules into a dictionary for quick lookup.
2. Implement functions to split the grid into smaller squares and to join squares back into a larger grid.
3. Create a function to apply the rules, including rotation and flipping of patterns.
4. Implement the main iteration logic that applies the rules for the specified number of iterations.
5. Count the number of '#' pixels in the final grid.

For efficiency:
- Use sets to store the active pixels instead of a 2D grid.
- Implement the rotations and flips as coordinate transformations.
- Use tuple representations of patterns for dictionary keys.

For Part Two, we'll simply increase the number of iterations from 5 to 18.
