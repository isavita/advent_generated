To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" as a string
2. Convert the string into a sequence of digits
3. Create a circular sequence by appending the first digit to the end
4. Use a combination of map and filter to find matching adjacent digits
5. Sum the matching digits

We'll use Clojure's built-in functions like slurp, map, filter, and reduce to create a concise and efficient solution. The circular nature of the list can be handled by simply appending the first digit to the end of the sequence.
