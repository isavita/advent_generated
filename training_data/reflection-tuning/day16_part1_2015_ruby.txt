To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to get the information about each Aunt Sue.
2. Define the MFCSAM readings as a hash.
3. Compare each Aunt Sue's attributes with the MFCSAM readings.
4. Find the Aunt Sue that matches all the known attributes.

The efficient approach would be to:
- Store each Aunt Sue's information in a hash for quick access.
- Use a single loop to go through all Aunts and check their attributes against the MFCSAM readings.
- Break the loop as soon as we find a match for all known attributes.
