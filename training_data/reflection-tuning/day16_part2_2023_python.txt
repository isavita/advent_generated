To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:

1. Parse the input file to create a 2D grid representing the contraption.
2. Implement a function to simulate the beam's movement through the grid.
3. For Part 1, run the simulation with the beam starting from the top-left corner.
4. For Part 2, iterate through all possible starting positions on the edges of the grid.
5. Use a set to keep track of energized tiles and beam positions to avoid infinite loops.
6. Optimize by using a queue for beam propagation and avoiding unnecessary calculations.

The key to efficiency is to avoid recalculating paths for beams that have already been processed and to use appropriate data structures for quick lookups and insertions.
