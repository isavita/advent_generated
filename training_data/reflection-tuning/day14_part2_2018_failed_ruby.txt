The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, probably using a brute-force approach that checked for the target sequence after each new recipe was added. This would be very slow for large inputs. To optimize this, we can use a more efficient string matching algorithm and only check for the target sequence when we've added enough recipes to potentially match it. We can also use a more efficient data structure to store the recipes, such as a string or an array with efficient append operations.
