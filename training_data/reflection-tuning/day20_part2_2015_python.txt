To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a mathematical approach rather than simulating the entire process. Here's the thought process:

1. For Part One:
   - We can use the concept of divisors sum. Each house number receives presents from elves whose numbers are divisors of that house number.
   - We can iterate through house numbers and calculate the sum of their divisors multiplied by 10.
   - We stop when we find the first house that meets or exceeds the target number.

2. For Part Two:
   - The approach is similar, but we need to consider that each elf only visits 50 houses.
   - We can modify our divisor sum calculation to only include divisors that are at most 50 times smaller than the house number.
   - We multiply the sum by 11 instead of 10.

To optimize the solution, we can use a sieve-like approach to calculate divisor sums for all houses up to a certain limit, and then check which house first meets the condition.
