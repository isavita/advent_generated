To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to create a 2D grid representing the lumber collection area.
2. Implement a function to simulate one minute of changes.
3. Create a function to count the number of wooded acres and lumberyards.
4. For Part 1, simply run the simulation for 10 minutes and calculate the result.
5. For Part 2, we need to optimize for 1,000,000,000 minutes. The key insight is that the pattern will eventually repeat. We can:
   a. Run the simulation until we detect a repeating pattern.
   b. Calculate how many minutes are left after the pattern starts repeating.
   c. Use modular arithmetic to find the state after 1,000,000,000 minutes.
6. Finally, calculate and return the resource value for both parts.
