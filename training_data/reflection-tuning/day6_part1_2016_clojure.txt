To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file line by line.
2. For each position in the strings, count the frequency of each character.
3. Find the most common character for each position.
4. Combine these most common characters to form the final message.

We can use Clojure's powerful sequence functions to achieve this concisely:
- `slurp` to read the file
- `clojure.string/split-lines` to split the input into lines
- `apply map vector` to transpose the lines, grouping characters by position
- `frequencies` to count character occurrences
- `max-key` to find the most frequent character
- `apply str` to combine the characters into the final string
