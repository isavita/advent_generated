To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input to create a map of modules and their connections.
2. Implement the logic for each type of module (broadcaster, flip-flop, conjunction).
3. Simulate the button press 1000 times, keeping track of low and high pulses.
4. Multiply the total low and high pulses to get the final answer.

The key aspects of the solution:
- Use a hash to store modules and their states.
- Implement a queue to process pulses in the correct order.
- Use a separate method for each module type to handle pulses.
- Keep track of low and high pulse counts globally.

The solution will simulate the entire process 1000 times and return the product of low and high pulse counts.
