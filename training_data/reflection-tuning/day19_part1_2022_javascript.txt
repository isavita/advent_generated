To solve this problem efficiently, we need to implement a depth-first search (DFS) with pruning. Here's the approach:

1. Parse the input to extract blueprint information.
2. For each blueprint, perform a DFS to find the maximum number of geodes that can be opened in 24 minutes.
3. Use pruning techniques to reduce the search space:
   - Set an upper bound on the number of robots we need for each resource.
   - Skip building a robot if we already have enough resources to build any robot every minute.
   - Prune branches that can't possibly beat the current best result.
4. Calculate the quality level for each blueprint and sum them up.

The key to efficiency is in the pruning strategies and avoiding unnecessary state copies during the search.
