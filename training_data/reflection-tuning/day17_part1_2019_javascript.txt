To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Read the input from "input.txt" which contains the ASCII program.
2. Implement an Intcode computer to run the ASCII program.
3. Collect the output of the program, which represents the scaffold view.
4. Parse the scaffold view to identify intersections.
5. Calculate the alignment parameters for each intersection.
6. Sum up all alignment parameters.

The key aspects to focus on are:
- Efficiently implementing the Intcode computer.
- Parsing the scaffold view to a 2D array for easy manipulation.
- Identifying intersections by checking adjacent positions.
- Calculating alignment parameters and summing them up.

We'll use Node.js's file system module to read the input file, and implement the Intcode computer as a class for better organization.
