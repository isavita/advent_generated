To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the input file and split it into groups based on blank lines.
2. For each group:
   a. Split the group into individual person's answers.
   b. For Part 1: Find the unique characters across all answers in the group.
   c. For Part 2: Find the characters that appear in all answers in the group.
3. Sum up the counts for both parts.

We can use Clojure's set operations to efficiently handle the character comparisons:
- For Part 1, we'll use `into` with `set` to get unique characters.
- For Part 2, we'll use `apply intersection` to find common characters across all answers.

This approach should be both concise and efficient, leveraging Clojure's built-in functions for set operations.
