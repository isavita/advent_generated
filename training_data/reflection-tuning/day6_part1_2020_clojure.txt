To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and split it into groups (separated by blank lines).
2. For each group, we need to:
   a. Combine all answers into a single string.
   b. Convert the string to a set to remove duplicates.
   c. Count the number of unique characters (yes answers).
3. Sum up the counts from all groups.

We can use Clojure's powerful sequence functions to achieve this concisely. We'll use `slurp` to read the file, `clojure.string/split` to separate groups, `mapcat` to flatten the answers within each group, `set` to get unique answers, and `count` to get the number of unique answers. Finally, we'll use `reduce` to sum up all the counts.
