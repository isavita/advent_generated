To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in a graph-like structure. Here's the approach:

1. We'll use a queue to store the states we need to explore. Each state will contain the current position and the path taken so far.
2. We'll use the MD5 hash function to determine which doors are open at each step.
3. We'll explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from each state, checking if the move is valid (within bounds and the door is open).
4. We'll continue this process until we reach the vault (bottom-right corner).
5. Since we're using BFS, the first path to reach the vault will be the shortest.

The solution will be efficient as it explores the shortest paths first and doesn't waste time on longer paths.
