To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with backtracking. Here's the thought process:

1. Read the container sizes from the input file.
2. Create a recursive function that tries all possible combinations of containers.
3. For each container, we have two choices: include it or exclude it.
4. Keep track of the current sum as we include containers.
5. If the sum reaches exactly 150, we've found a valid combination.
6. If the sum exceeds 150, we can stop exploring that branch (backtracking).
7. Count the total number of valid combinations.

This approach efficiently explores all possibilities without generating all combinations upfront, which could be memory-intensive for a large number of containers.
