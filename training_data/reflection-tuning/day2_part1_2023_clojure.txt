To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file line by line
2. Parse each game, extracting the game ID and the sets of cubes
3. Check if each set in a game is possible given the constraints (12 red, 13 green, 14 blue)
4. If all sets in a game are possible, add the game ID to our sum
5. Finally, print the total sum of possible game IDs

We can use Clojure's powerful string manipulation and data processing functions to efficiently parse the input and check the conditions. We'll use regular expressions to extract the game ID and cube counts, and we'll use Clojure's threading macros to make the code more readable.
