The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using an inefficient algorithm, possibly a brute-force approach or a depth-first search without proper optimization. To fix this issue, we should implement a more efficient algorithm, such as a breadth-first search (BFS) with some optimizations. 

Key optimizations to consider:
1. Use a priority queue to always explore the most promising paths first.
2. Implement a state-based approach where each state includes the current position, collected keys, and steps taken.
3. Use bitwise operations to efficiently represent and manipulate the set of collected keys.
4. Implement a caching mechanism to avoid revisiting already explored states.
5. Precompute distances between keys and the entrance to avoid redundant path finding.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the execution time and solve the timeout issue.
