To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the following approach:

1. Parse the input file to extract the reboot steps.
2. Create a 3D grid (101x101x101) to represent the initialization region (-50..50 for each dimension).
3. Iterate through each reboot step:
   - If the step is within the initialization region, update the grid accordingly.
   - Skip steps that are completely outside the region.
4. After processing all steps, count the number of "on" cubes in the grid.

This approach is memory-efficient as we're only storing the state of cubes within the initialization region. It's also time-efficient as we're processing each step only once and updating the grid directly.
