Looking at the previous output, it seems the solution for Part 1 (3943) is likely incorrect, as it's much higher than the example given (which had 38 safe tiles in 10 rows). The Part 2 answer (39999943) also seems suspiciously high and close to the total number of tiles (400000 * width of input).

The issue might be in the logic for counting safe tiles or in the rule implementation for determining trap/safe tiles. It's possible that the code is counting traps instead of safe tiles, or that the rules for determining new tiles are not correctly implemented.

To fix this, we should:
1. Ensure we're counting safe tiles (.) and not trap tiles (^)
2. Double-check the implementation of the rules for determining new tiles
3. Verify that we're correctly handling the edges of each row
4. Make sure we're processing the correct number of rows (40 for Part 1, 400000 for Part 2)

Let's rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind.
