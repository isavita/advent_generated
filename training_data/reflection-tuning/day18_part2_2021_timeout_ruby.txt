The error message indicates that we're trying to call the `length` method on `nil` in the `explode` function. This suggests that `pair[0]` is `nil` at some point during the execution. The issue likely occurs when we're trying to process a pair that doesn't have the expected structure.

To fix this, we should add a check to ensure that `pair[0]` is not `nil` before trying to access its length. We should also review our pair parsing logic to make sure we're correctly identifying and handling all possible pair structures.

Additionally, we should implement proper error handling to gracefully handle unexpected input or edge cases.
