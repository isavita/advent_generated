The error message indicates that the variable 'i' is not defined in the scope where it's being used. This suggests that the loop variable 'i' from an outer loop is being used inside a list comprehension, which creates its own scope. To fix this, we need to pass the 'i' variable into the list comprehension or restructure the code to avoid this issue.

Additionally, the error occurs in the find_overlap function, which seems to be trying to compare beacons from two different scanners. The approach of using a single index 'i' for all dimensions might be overly complicated and prone to errors. 

A better approach would be to:
1. Generate all possible rotations for the beacons of the second scanner.
2. For each rotation, try to find a common offset that aligns at least 12 beacons.
3. If such an alignment is found, transform all beacons of the second scanner and add them to the first scanner's set of beacons.

This approach would be more robust and easier to implement correctly.
