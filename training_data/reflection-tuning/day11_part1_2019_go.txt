To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Implement an Intcode computer to execute the given program.
2. Create a robot that moves on a 2D grid, painting panels and changing direction based on the Intcode program's output.
3. Keep track of the painted panels and count unique panels painted.

The approach will be:
1. Use a map to store the painted panels, with coordinates as keys and colors as values.
2. Implement the Intcode computer with support for input/output and halting.
3. Create a robot struct to manage position, direction, and movement.
4. Run the Intcode program, providing input based on the current panel color and updating the robot's position and panel colors based on the output.
5. Count the number of unique panels painted at the end.

This solution will be memory-efficient as it only stores painted panels, and time-efficient as it processes the Intcode program once.
