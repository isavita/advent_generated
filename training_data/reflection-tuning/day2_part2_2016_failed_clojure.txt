To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file and parse it into a list of instructions.
2. Implement two different keypad layouts for Part 1 and Part 2.
3. Create a function to move on each keypad based on the instructions.
4. Iterate through the instructions, keeping track of the current position and building the code.
5. Print the final codes for both parts.

We'll use a map to represent each keypad, where the keys are the current positions and the values are maps of possible moves. This allows for efficient lookups and handles edge cases naturally.
