To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to create a map of the tracks and identify the initial positions and directions of the carts.
2. Simulate the movement of carts tick by tick.
3. For each tick, move carts in order (top to bottom, left to right).
4. Handle intersections by implementing the turning logic.
5. Check for collisions after each cart's movement.
6. Return the coordinates of the first collision.

We'll use a 2D slice to represent the track, and a slice of structs to represent the carts. We'll sort the carts before each tick to ensure they move in the correct order.
