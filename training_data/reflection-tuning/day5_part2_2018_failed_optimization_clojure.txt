The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, probably due to repeated string manipulations or excessive recursion. To fix this, we should focus on optimizing the polymer reaction process. Instead of manipulating strings, we can use a more efficient data structure like a stack (which can be implemented using a vector in Clojure). This approach allows us to process the polymer in a single pass, which should significantly improve performance.

For Part Two, instead of generating all possible polymers by removing each unit type, we can optimize by first removing all instances of a unit type (regardless of polarity) and then applying the reaction process to the resulting polymer. We can do this for each unit type and keep track of the shortest resulting polymer.
