To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file containing the masses of modules.
2. Define a function to calculate fuel for a given mass.
3. Apply this function to each mass in the input.
4. Sum up all the calculated fuel requirements.

The fuel calculation function will implement the formula: fuel = (mass / 3) rounded down - 2.
We'll use Clojure's built-in functions like slurp, split-lines, and map to read and process the input file efficiently.
