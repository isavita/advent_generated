To solve this problem, we need to approach it in two parts:

1. For Part One:
   - Parse the input to create particle objects with position, velocity, and acceleration.
   - Implement a function to update particle positions over time.
   - Calculate the Manhattan distance for each particle from the origin.
   - Find the particle that stays closest to the origin in the long term.

2. For Part Two:
   - Implement collision detection after each update.
   - Remove colliding particles.
   - Continue updating and checking for collisions until no more collisions occur.
   - Count the remaining particles.

The key to efficiency here is to:
- Use a Map to store particles by their position for quick collision checks.
- Run the simulation for a sufficient number of iterations to ensure long-term behavior is captured.
- Use vector operations for updating particle properties.
