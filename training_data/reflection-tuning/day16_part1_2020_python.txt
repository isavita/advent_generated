To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to extract the rules, our ticket, and nearby tickets.
2. Create a set of all valid numbers based on the rules.
3. Iterate through the nearby tickets, checking each number against the set of valid numbers.
4. If a number is not in the valid set, add it to our error rate sum.
5. Return the final error rate sum.

This approach is efficient because:
- We use a set for O(1) lookup time when checking if a number is valid.
- We only iterate through the nearby tickets once.
- We don't need to keep track of which field each number corresponds to, as per the problem statement.
