The error message indicates that there's a NameError in the lambda function used for row transformation. Specifically, it's trying to use a variable 'c' that is not defined. This suggests that the lambda functions for row and column transformations might be swapped or incorrectly defined.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the lambda functions are using the correct variables. For row transformations, we should use 'r', and for column transformations, we should use 'c'. Additionally, we should double-check all the face transition rules to make sure they're correctly defined.

I'll revise the code, focusing on the face_transitions dictionary and the move_on_cube function to ensure that the lambda functions are correctly defined and used.
