Based on the given output, it seems that Part 1 was solved correctly (12516), but Part 2 might be incorrect. The issue likely lies in how the program handles the increased input value (from 7 to 12) for Part 2. The problem mentions that the computer begins to overheat, suggesting that the program might be taking too long to execute or getting stuck in a loop.

To address this, we should consider optimizing the code, especially for larger input values. The hint about bunnies multiplying suggests that we might need to implement a more efficient way to handle multiplication or exponential growth in the program.

One approach could be to analyze the assembly code and identify any patterns or loops that could be optimized. We might be able to replace certain sequences of instructions with more efficient operations, especially if they involve multiplication or repeated addition.

Another possibility is to implement a way to detect cycles in the program execution and use mathematical shortcuts to calculate the final result without running through all iterations.
