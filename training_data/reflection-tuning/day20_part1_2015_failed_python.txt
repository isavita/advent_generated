To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a mathematical approach rather than simulating the entire process. Here's the thought process:

1. We need to find the sum of factors for each house number, multiplied by 10.
2. Instead of checking each house individually, we can use a sieve-like approach.
3. We'll create an array to store the number of presents for each house.
4. We'll iterate through the Elves (starting from 1) and update the presents for all houses they visit.
5. We'll stop when we find the first house that has at least as many presents as the input number.

This approach is more efficient than calculating factors for each house individually, as it distributes the work across all houses simultaneously.
