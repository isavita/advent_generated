The error message indicates that the "math" package is imported but not used in the code. This suggests that the previous solution might have included an unnecessary import statement for the "math" package. To fix this issue, we should remove the unused import statement. Additionally, since the problem involves calculating distances in a hex grid and finding the maximum distance, we'll need to implement logic for tracking the current position and the maximum distance reached.
