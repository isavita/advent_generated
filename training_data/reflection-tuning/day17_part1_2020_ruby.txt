To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the initial state from the input file.
2. Create a data structure to represent the active cubes (a set of coordinates would be efficient).
3. Implement a function to simulate one cycle:
   - For each active cube and its neighbors, count active neighbors.
   - Determine which cubes will be active in the next state.
4. Repeat the simulation for six cycles.
5. Count the number of active cubes after six cycles.

To optimize performance:
- Use a set to store active cube coordinates, allowing for fast lookups and updates.
- Only consider cubes that are active or adjacent to active cubes in each cycle.
- Use a helper method to generate neighbor coordinates.

This approach minimizes unnecessary computations and memory usage while accurately simulating the Conway Cube rules.
