To solve this maze problem efficiently, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the approach:

1. Parse the input to create a 2D grid representation of the maze.
2. Identify all portals, including the start (AA) and end (ZZ) points.
3. Create a graph representation where each node is a walkable position, and edges represent possible moves (including portal teleportations).
4. Use BFS to find the shortest path from AA to ZZ.
5. Count the steps in the shortest path.

The key optimizations are:
- Using a Set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting.
- Using a Queue for BFS to ensure we explore the shortest paths first.
- Pre-computing portal connections to avoid repeated searches during pathfinding.
