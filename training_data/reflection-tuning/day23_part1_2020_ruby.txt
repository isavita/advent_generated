To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider the following points:

1. The circle of cups can be represented as a linked list, where each cup points to the next cup.
2. We can use an array to store the next cup for each cup label, allowing O(1) access to any cup's next cup.
3. Instead of physically moving cups, we'll update the links between cups.
4. We'll keep track of the current cup and perform the operations as described in the problem.
5. After 100 moves, we'll traverse the list starting from cup 1 to get the final order.

This approach will be much more efficient than manipulating an array, especially for large numbers of cups and moves.
