To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and split it into lines.
2. Create a function to check if a position is a tree (#).
3. Implement a function to traverse the map with the given slope (right 3, down 1).
4. Count the number of trees encountered during the traversal.

We'll use Clojure's built-in functions for file reading and sequence manipulation. The key is to use modular arithmetic to handle the repeating pattern of the map horizontally.
