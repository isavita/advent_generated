The error message "-1" typically indicates that the algorithm failed to find a valid solution or reached an invalid state. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The search algorithm might not be exploring all possible states correctly.
2. The state representation or transition logic might be flawed, leading to invalid states.
3. The termination condition might be incorrect, causing the search to end prematurely.
4. There might be an issue with the input parsing or initial state setup.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. The state representation accurately captures all aspects of the problem (floors, items, elevator position).
2. The state transition logic correctly generates all valid next states.
3. The search algorithm (likely BFS or A*) explores all possible paths.
4. The goal state check is correct and comprehensive.
5. The input is parsed correctly and the initial state is set up properly.

I'll provide a revised solution that addresses these potential issues.
