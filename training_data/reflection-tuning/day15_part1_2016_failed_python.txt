The previous solution likely produced an incorrect output of 385992, which seems too high for this problem. The issue might be in how the disc positions are calculated or how the time is incremented. A common mistake in these types of problems is not properly handling the offset between the time the button is pressed and when the capsule reaches each disc.

To fix this, we should ensure that:
1. We're correctly calculating the position of each disc at the time the capsule reaches it.
2. We're incrementing the time properly and checking all discs for each time step.
3. We're considering the offset between button press time and when the capsule reaches each disc.

I'll rewrite the solution with these considerations in mind, using a more straightforward approach that checks each time step until we find a valid solution.
