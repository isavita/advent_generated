To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider the following approach:

1. Create a function to generate MD5 hashes for a given salt and index.
2. Implement key stretching by repeatedly hashing 2016 times.
3. Use a sliding window of 1000 hashes to check for potential keys.
4. Keep track of the found keys and their indices.
5. Optimize by caching generated hashes to avoid redundant calculations.
6. Use goroutines to parallelize hash generation and checking for improved performance.

The main challenge is to balance between memory usage (for caching) and computation time. We'll use a fixed-size cache to store recent hashes and implement concurrent processing to speed up the solution.
