To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file to extract the rules, our ticket, and nearby tickets.
2. Create a set of all valid numbers based on the rules.
3. Iterate through nearby tickets, checking each number against the set of valid numbers.
4. Sum up all invalid numbers found.

This approach allows us to quickly check if a number is valid without repeatedly parsing the rules for each number. Using a set for valid numbers provides O(1) lookup time, making the solution efficient.
