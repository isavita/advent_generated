The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely using an inefficient approach, possibly iterating through houses one by one until finding the answer. This can be extremely slow for large input numbers. To optimize this, we can use a more mathematical approach:

1. Instead of calculating presents for each house sequentially, we can use the fact that each house number is the sum of its factors multiplied by 11.
2. We can iterate through house numbers and calculate their total presents using their factors.
3. To find factors efficiently, we only need to check up to the square root of the house number.
4. We can also limit each elf to 50 houses by keeping track of how many houses each elf has visited.

This approach should be significantly faster and avoid the timeout issue.
