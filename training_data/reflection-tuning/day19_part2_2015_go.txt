To solve this problem, we need to approach it in two parts:

1. For Part One:
   - Parse the input file to extract the replacements and the medicine molecule.
   - For each replacement, find all possible positions in the medicine molecule where it can be applied.
   - Apply each replacement at each possible position and store the resulting molecules in a set to avoid duplicates.
   - Count the number of unique molecules in the set.

2. For Part Two:
   - This is a more complex problem that requires working backwards from the medicine molecule to 'e'.
   - We can use a greedy approach with randomization:
     - Randomly shuffle the replacements.
     - Repeatedly apply the replacements in reverse (replacing the right side with the left side) to the medicine molecule.
     - If we get stuck, we start over with a new random shuffle.
   - We keep track of the minimum number of steps found so far.

This approach may not guarantee the absolute minimum number of steps, but it should provide a reasonably good solution efficiently.
