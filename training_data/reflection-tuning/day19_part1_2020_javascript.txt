To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to separate rules and messages.
2. Create a function to build a regular expression from the rules.
3. Use the regular expression to match messages against rule 0.
4. Count the number of messages that completely match rule 0.

The key to efficiency here is to use regular expressions. We can convert the rules into a single regular expression, which can then be used to quickly match against all messages. We'll use a Map to store the rules and build the regex recursively.
