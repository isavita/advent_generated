Based on the incorrect output provided, it seems the main issue is in Part 2 of the problem. The answer 4444 is too low, which suggests that the boost calculation or the simulation with the boost might not be implemented correctly. 

The key aspects to focus on for fixing this issue would be:

1. Ensure that the boost is being applied correctly to all immune system groups.
2. Implement a binary search or similar algorithm to find the smallest boost that leads to an immune system victory.
3. Make sure the simulation runs until there's a clear winner (either immune system or infection).
4. Verify that the counting of remaining units is done correctly after the immune system wins.

I would approach the solution by implementing a clear separation between the battle simulation and the boost finding logic. Then, I'd use a binary search to efficiently find the smallest boost that leads to an immune system victory.
