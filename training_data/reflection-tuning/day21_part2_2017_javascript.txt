The error message indicates that 'enhanced' is undefined when trying to call the forEach method on it. This suggests that the 'enhance' function is not correctly creating or returning the 'enhanced' array. The issue might be in how the new grid is being constructed or how the rules are being applied. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. The 'enhance' function is correctly creating and populating the 'enhanced' array.
2. All edge cases are handled, especially when dividing the grid into smaller squares.
3. The rule application and grid reconstruction are working as expected.

I'll revise the code, focusing on these areas and ensuring that the 'enhanced' array is properly created and returned in all cases.
