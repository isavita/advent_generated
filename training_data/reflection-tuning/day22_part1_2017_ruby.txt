To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to create the initial grid.
2. Implement the virus carrier's movement and infection logic.
3. Use a hash to store infected nodes, allowing for an infinite grid.
4. Simulate 10000 bursts and count the number of infections caused.

Key optimizations:
- Use a hash to store only infected nodes, saving memory for large grids.
- Use complex numbers for position and direction, simplifying movement calculations.
- Pre-calculate the initial grid center to place the virus carrier.
