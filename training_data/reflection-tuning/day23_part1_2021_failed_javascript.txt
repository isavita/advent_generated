Based on the error message "-1", it seems the previous solution might have failed to find a valid path to organize the amphipods or returned an invalid energy value. The problem requires implementing a complex pathfinding algorithm with specific rules for amphipod movement. 

To fix this issue, we need to:
1. Ensure we're correctly implementing the movement rules for amphipods.
2. Use an efficient search algorithm (like A* or Dijkstra's) to find the least energy path.
3. Properly handle all possible states and transitions.
4. Implement a priority queue to always explore the most promising states first.
5. Add proper memoization or caching to avoid redundant calculations.

The solution will likely involve:
- Representing the burrow state efficiently
- Implementing valid move generation
- Using a priority queue for state exploration
- Caching intermediate results
- Carefully handling the complex movement rules
