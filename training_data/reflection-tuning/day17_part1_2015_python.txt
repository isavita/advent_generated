To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with backtracking. Here's the thought process:

1. Read the container sizes from the input file.
2. Create a recursive function that tries all possible combinations of containers.
3. For each container, we have two choices: include it or not include it.
4. Keep track of the current sum and the target (150 liters).
5. If the current sum equals the target, we've found a valid combination.
6. If the current sum exceeds the target, we can stop exploring this branch (backtracking).
7. Count the number of valid combinations.

This approach is efficient because it explores all possibilities while pruning branches that exceed the target, avoiding unnecessary computations.
