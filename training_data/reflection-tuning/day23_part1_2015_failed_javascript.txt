The error message indicates that there's a problem with the regular expression matching in the `executeProgram` function. Specifically, it's trying to destructure a null value, which means the regex didn't match the instruction. This could happen if some instructions in the input don't follow the expected format. To fix this, we should make the regex more flexible and add error handling for cases where the instruction doesn't match the expected format.

Additionally, we should ensure that all the required functions and variables are properly defined, including the `registers` object and the `instructions` array. We'll also need to implement all the instruction types mentioned in the problem description.
