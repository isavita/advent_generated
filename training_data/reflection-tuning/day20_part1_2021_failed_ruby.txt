To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the input file and parse it into the enhancement algorithm and the initial image.
2. Implement a function to enhance the image, considering the infinite nature of the image.
3. Apply the enhancement algorithm twice.
4. Count the number of lit pixels in the final image.

Key considerations:
- We need to handle the infinite nature of the image by adding a border of dark pixels around the image before each enhancement.
- We should keep track of the "default" state of the infinite pixels outside our visible area, as it may change between enhancements.
- We can represent the image as a set of coordinates for lit pixels to save memory.
