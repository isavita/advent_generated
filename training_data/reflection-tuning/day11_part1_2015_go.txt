The output "hxccbcdd" seems to be an incorrect password generated by the previous solution. The main issues I can identify are:

1. The password doesn't meet the requirement of having an increasing straight of at least three letters.
2. It's not clear if the password avoids the letters i, o, and l.
3. While it does contain two different, non-overlapping pairs (cc and dd), we need to ensure this is consistently checked.

To fix these issues, we need to implement a more robust password generation and validation system. We should:

1. Implement a function to increment the password correctly.
2. Create separate functions to check each requirement.
3. Implement a main function that keeps incrementing the password until all requirements are met.

I'll revise the solution to address these points and ensure all requirements are properly checked.
