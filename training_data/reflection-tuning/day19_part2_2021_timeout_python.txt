The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, probably due to excessive nested loops or an inefficient algorithm for matching beacons between scanners. To address this, we can implement the following optimizations:

1. Use sets instead of lists for faster lookups and comparisons.
2. Implement a more efficient algorithm for finding overlapping beacons between scanners.
3. Use a hashing technique to quickly identify potential matches between scanners.
4. Implement memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
5. Use itertools.combinations for more efficient pair generation.

These optimizations should significantly reduce the execution time while maintaining the correct functionality.
