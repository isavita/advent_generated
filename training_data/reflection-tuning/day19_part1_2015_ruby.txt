To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the replacement rules and the medicine molecule.
2. For each replacement rule, find all occurrences of the 'from' part in the medicine molecule.
3. For each occurrence, create a new molecule by replacing that occurrence with the 'to' part.
4. Keep track of all unique molecules created.
5. Count and return the number of unique molecules.

We can use a hash to store the replacement rules and a set to keep track of unique molecules. This will ensure efficiency in lookups and prevent duplicates.
