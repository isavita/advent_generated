The error message indicates that the program is unable to find the module './intcode'. This suggests that the previous solution was trying to import a module named 'intcode' from the same directory, but this module doesn't exist or isn't in the correct location.

To fix this issue, we need to implement the Intcode computer functionality within our main script instead of trying to import it. We'll need to create functions to handle the Intcode operations and then use these to simulate the drone system.

Additionally, we need to implement the logic for both parts of the problem: counting the points affected by the tractor beam in a 50x50 area, and finding the 100x100 square that fits entirely within the beam.
