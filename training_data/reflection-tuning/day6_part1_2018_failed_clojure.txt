Upon analyzing the problem, I realize that the previous solution might have failed due to a few potential issues:

1. Incorrect handling of infinite areas: The solution might not have properly identified and excluded areas that extend infinitely.
2. Inefficient distance calculation: The Manhattan distance calculation might have been implemented inefficiently.
3. Incorrect area size calculation: The method for counting the size of each area might have been flawed.

To address these issues, I would approach the solution as follows:

1. Parse the input coordinates.
2. Create a grid that's slightly larger than the input coordinates to handle edge cases.
3. For each point in the grid, calculate the Manhattan distance to all coordinates.
4. Assign each point to the closest coordinate, or mark it as tied if there are multiple closest coordinates.
5. Identify infinite areas by checking the edges of the grid.
6. Count the size of each finite area.
7. Return the size of the largest finite area.

This approach should correctly handle infinite areas and efficiently calculate distances and area sizes.
