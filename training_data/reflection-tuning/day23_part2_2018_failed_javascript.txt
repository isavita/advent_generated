The error message indicates a "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error, which typically occurs due to infinite recursion or extremely deep recursion. In this case, it's likely that the `findBestPoint` function is calling itself recursively without a proper base case or termination condition. To fix this, we need to redesign the algorithm to avoid excessive recursion.

Instead of using a recursive approach, we can implement an iterative solution that gradually narrows down the search space. We'll start with a large bounding box that contains all nanobots and iteratively divide it into smaller octants, always choosing the octant with the highest potential. This approach will prevent stack overflow and should be more efficient.

We'll also need to implement helper functions to calculate the distance between points and to check if a point is within a nanobot's range.
