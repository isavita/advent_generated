To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input to extract the target area coordinates.
2. For Part 1, we can realize that the maximum height is achieved when the probe goes straight up and then comes back down to the target area. The maximum y velocity will be the absolute value of the lower y bound of the target area minus 1.
3. For Part 2, we need to simulate trajectories for a range of initial velocities. We can set bounds for these velocities:
   - x velocity: from 1 to the maximum x of the target area
   - y velocity: from the minimum y of the target area to the absolute value of the minimum y
4. We'll create a function to simulate a trajectory and check if it hits the target area.
5. We'll count all valid initial velocities.

This approach is efficient because it limits the search space and avoids unnecessary calculations.
