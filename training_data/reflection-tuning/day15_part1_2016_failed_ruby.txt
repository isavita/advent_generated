The error message indicates a division by zero error occurring in the `passes?` method. This suggests that one of the discs might have zero positions, which is not a valid scenario according to the problem description. To fix this, we need to ensure that we're not dividing by zero and that all discs have at least one position. We should add a check to ensure that no disc has zero positions before performing the modulo operation.

Additionally, we should review how we're calculating the position of each disc at the time it's reached by the capsule. The calculation should take into account the initial position, the time passed, and the number of positions on the disc.
