To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Parse the input and create a 3D representation of the bricks.
2. Simulate the falling of bricks to their final positions.
3. Build a graph of support relationships between bricks.
4. For each brick, calculate how many other bricks would fall if it were removed.

Key optimizations:
- Use a hash to store the bricks for quick access.
- Use sets to efficiently track supporting and supported-by relationships.
- Use a queue for the falling simulation to avoid unnecessary iterations.
- Implement a depth-first search (DFS) to count falling bricks efficiently.
