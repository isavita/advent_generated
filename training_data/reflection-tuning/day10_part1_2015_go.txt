To solve this problem, we need to implement the look-and-say sequence generation algorithm and apply it 40 times to the input. Here's the approach:

1. Read the input from "input.txt".
2. Implement a function to generate the next sequence in the look-and-say sequence.
3. Apply this function 40 times to the input.
4. Calculate the length of the final sequence.

For efficiency, we'll use strings.Builder to construct the new sequences, as it's more efficient than string concatenation. We'll also use a single loop to count consecutive digits and build the new sequence simultaneously.
