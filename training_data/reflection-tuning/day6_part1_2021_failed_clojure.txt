The error message indicates that there's a ClassCastException occurring in the `simulate-days` function. Specifically, it's trying to cast a PersistentVector to a Number, which is not possible. This suggests that somewhere in the code, we're trying to perform a numeric operation on a vector instead of a number.

The most likely cause of this error is that we're not properly handling the fish population data structure. Instead of working with individual numbers representing fish timers, we might be accidentally working with the entire vector of fish timers at some point.

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. We're properly iterating over the fish population vector.
2. We're correctly updating individual fish timers.
3. We're handling the creation of new fish correctly.

I'll revise the code to address these potential issues, focusing on properly manipulating the fish timer values and ensuring we're working with individual numbers rather than the entire vector.
