The error message indicates a stack overflow due to excessive recursion in the `dfs` function. This is likely caused by the depth-first search going too deep or getting stuck in cycles. To fix this, we can change our approach from a recursive DFS to an iterative one using a stack. This will prevent the stack overflow error and allow us to handle larger inputs.

Additionally, we should implement a more efficient way to track visited nodes, possibly using a set instead of modifying the grid directly. This will allow us to backtrack and explore all possible paths without permanently marking cells as visited.

For Part Two, we need to ignore the slope directions and treat all paths as regular paths. We can achieve this by modifying our neighbor selection logic.
