To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the instructions from the input file.
2. Implement each operation as a separate method.
3. Apply the operations in order to the initial password "abcdefgh".
4. Print the final scrambled password.

The key is to carefully implement each operation, ensuring we handle edge cases and follow the instructions precisely. We'll use a single string variable to represent the password and modify it in-place for efficiency.
