Based on the incorrect output provided, it seems the previous solution was close but not quite accurate. The main issues could be:

1. The logic for determining trap tiles might be slightly off, leading to incorrect counting of safe tiles.
2. The implementation for Part 2 might not be efficient enough to handle 400,000 rows without excessive time or memory usage.

To fix these issues, we should:

1. Double-check the trap determination logic to ensure it exactly matches the problem description.
2. Implement an efficient solution that doesn't store all rows in memory, but instead only keeps track of the current row and the count of safe tiles.
3. Use a more optimized method to generate each new row based on the previous one.

Let's implement these improvements in the revised solution.
