To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the secret key from the input file.
2. Implement a function to generate MD5 hashes.
3. Create a loop that incrementally tries numbers, combining them with the secret key.
4. Check if the resulting hash starts with six zeroes (for Part Two).
5. Return the lowest number that satisfies the condition.

For efficiency, we'll use Clojure's lazy sequences to generate and test numbers. We'll also use Java's built-in MessageDigest class for MD5 hashing, as it's likely to be faster than a pure Clojure implementation.
