To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input to extract sensor and beacon positions.
2. Calculate the Manhattan distance between each sensor and its closest beacon.
3. For the target row (y=2000000), determine the range of x-coordinates that each sensor covers.
4. Merge overlapping ranges to get the total coverage.
5. Count the number of unique positions covered, excluding any beacons on the target row.

We'll use a set to keep track of beacon positions on the target row and a list of tuples to store the ranges. Merging ranges will help us handle overlaps efficiently.
