The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to a brute-force approach or unnecessary repetitive calculations. To address this, we should focus on optimizing the algorithm. Here are some potential improvements:

1. Use a more efficient method for finding overlapping beacons between scanners.
2. Implement memoization to avoid recalculating distances or transformations.
3. Use set operations for faster intersection checks.
4. Optimize the rotation calculations by pre-computing all possible rotations.
5. Implement early termination conditions when finding matches.

I'll revise the solution with these optimizations in mind, focusing on efficient data structures and algorithms to reduce the overall computation time.
