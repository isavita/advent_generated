To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Read the SNAFU numbers from the input file.
2. Convert each SNAFU number to decimal.
3. Sum up all the decimal numbers.
4. Convert the sum back to SNAFU.

For the SNAFU to decimal conversion, we'll use a dictionary to map SNAFU digits to their decimal values. We'll then iterate through the SNAFU number from right to left, multiplying each digit by the appropriate power of 5.

For the decimal to SNAFU conversion, we'll use a similar approach but in reverse. We'll find the highest power of 5 that fits into the number, then work our way down, choosing the appropriate SNAFU digit at each step.

We'll implement these as separate functions for clarity and reusability.
