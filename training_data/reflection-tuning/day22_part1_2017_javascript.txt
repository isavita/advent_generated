To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to create a 2D grid representation of the initial infection state.
2. Implement the virus carrier's movement and infection logic.
3. Keep track of the carrier's position and direction.
4. Count the number of bursts that cause an infection.
5. Run the simulation for 10000 bursts.

We can use a Map to store the infected nodes, using string keys like "x,y" to represent coordinates. This allows for an infinite grid without pre-allocating a large array. We'll use directions as an array to easily rotate left or right.
