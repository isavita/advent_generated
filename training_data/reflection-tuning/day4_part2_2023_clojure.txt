To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. Parse the input file, extracting the winning numbers and the numbers we have for each card.
2. Create a function to count the number of matching numbers for each card.
3. Initialize a vector to keep track of the number of copies of each card, starting with 1 for each original card.
4. Iterate through the cards, updating the copies of subsequent cards based on the number of matches.
5. Sum up the total number of cards (original + copies) at the end.

The key to efficiency here is to use vectors for fast access and updates, and to process the cards in order, which allows us to update future card counts in a single pass.
