To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the following approach:

1. Read the target number of presents from the input file.
2. Instead of simulating the elves' deliveries, we can use a mathematical approach.
3. For each house number, we can calculate the sum of its factors multiplied by 10.
4. We'll iterate through house numbers until we find the first one that receives at least the target number of presents.
5. To optimize further, we can use a sieve-like approach to calculate the factors efficiently.

This approach avoids unnecessary calculations and allows us to find the answer quickly without simulating the entire process.
