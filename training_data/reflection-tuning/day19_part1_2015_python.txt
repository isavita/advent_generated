To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract the replacement rules and the medicine molecule.
2. For each possible replacement in the medicine molecule, apply the rule and generate a new molecule.
3. Keep track of unique molecules generated.
4. Count the number of unique molecules.

The efficient approach would be:
- Use a dictionary to store replacement rules for quick lookup.
- Iterate through the medicine molecule once, checking for possible replacements at each position.
- Use a set to store unique molecules, which allows for constant-time addition and eliminates duplicates automatically.
