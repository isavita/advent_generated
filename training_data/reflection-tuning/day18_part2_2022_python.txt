To solve this problem, we need to approach it in two steps:

1. For Part 1:
   - Read the input coordinates and create a set of cubes.
   - For each cube, check its six adjacent sides.
   - If an adjacent side doesn't have a cube, increment the surface area.

2. For Part 2:
   - We need to find the exterior surface area, excluding trapped air pockets.
   - We can use a flood fill algorithm starting from outside the droplet.
   - First, determine the bounds of the droplet and create a slightly larger bounding box.
   - Perform a 3D flood fill from a corner of this bounding box.
   - Count the surfaces where the flood fill touches the lava droplet.

This approach will efficiently solve both parts of the problem in a single pass through the data.
