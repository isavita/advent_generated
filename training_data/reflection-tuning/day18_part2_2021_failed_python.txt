To solve this problem, we need to implement several key functions:

1. Parse the input: Convert the string representation of snailfish numbers into a nested list structure.
2. Addition: Implement the addition operation for snailfish numbers.
3. Explosion: Implement the explosion operation for nested pairs.
4. Splitting: Implement the splitting operation for large regular numbers.
5. Reduction: Combine explosion and splitting in a loop until the number is fully reduced.
6. Magnitude calculation: Recursively calculate the magnitude of a snailfish number.

For Part 1, we'll add all numbers in the input sequentially and calculate the final magnitude.
For Part 2, we'll try all possible pairs of numbers, add them, and find the maximum magnitude.

The main challenge is to implement the explosion operation efficiently, as it requires traversing the nested structure and modifying it in place.
