To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we can follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and split it into groups of numbers separated by blank lines.
2. Convert each group into a sum of its numbers.
3. Sort the sums in descending order.
4. For Part 1, take the maximum (first element after sorting).
5. For Part 2, take the sum of the top three elements.

We'll use Clojure's built-in functions like `slurp`, `split`, `map`, `reduce`, and `take` to accomplish this task efficiently.
