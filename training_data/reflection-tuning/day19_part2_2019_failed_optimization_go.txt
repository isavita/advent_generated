The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to a brute-force approach that checked every single point in the 50x50 or 100x100 grid. To optimize this, we can take advantage of the beam's properties:

1. The beam expands as it moves away from the emitter.
2. The beam is continuous, meaning once we find a point inside the beam, we know all points below and to the right of it (within reason) are also in the beam.

We can use these properties to implement a more efficient search algorithm:

1. For Part 1, we can scan each row from left to right, stopping once we find the end of the beam in that row.
2. For Part 2, we can use a binary search approach to find the 100x100 square, starting from a reasonable minimum distance.

This approach should significantly reduce the number of checks we need to perform, thus avoiding the timeout issue.
