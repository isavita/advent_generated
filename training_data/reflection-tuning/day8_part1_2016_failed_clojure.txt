Based on the error message, it appears that there's an issue with the `apply-instruction` function, specifically when handling the "y" case. This suggests that there might be a problem with parsing or handling the "rotate row" instruction. The error occurs when trying to match a clause for "y", which is likely part of the instruction parsing.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `apply-instruction` function correctly handles all types of instructions, including "rotate row y=A by B". We should review the parsing logic for instructions and make sure it correctly extracts the row number and rotation amount for "rotate row" instructions.

Additionally, we should implement proper error handling to avoid runtime errors and provide more informative error messages.
