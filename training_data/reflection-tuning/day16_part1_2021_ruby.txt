To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Convert the hexadecimal input to binary
2. Parse the binary data recursively to extract all packets
3. Sum up the version numbers of all packets

The key steps in our approach will be:
- Create a function to convert hex to binary
- Implement a recursive function to parse packets
- Keep track of the current position in the binary string
- Handle both literal and operator packets
- Sum up all version numbers encountered

We'll use bitwise operations and string manipulation for efficiency.
