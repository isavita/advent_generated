The previous solution likely had an issue with correctly identifying which bricks can be safely disintegrated. The error output of 733 suggests that the solution was counting too many bricks as safe to disintegrate. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that:
1. We're correctly simulating the falling of bricks to their final positions.
2. We're accurately determining which bricks are supporting which other bricks.
3. We're correctly identifying which bricks can be safely removed without causing others to fall.

The key is to create a support system where we know which bricks are supporting each brick and which bricks each brick is supporting. Then, we can consider a brick safe to disintegrate if all the bricks it's supporting are also supported by at least one other brick.

Let's implement this approach with careful attention to these details.
