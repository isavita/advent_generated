The error message indicates that there's an issue with the `transpose` method being called on a String instead of an Array. This suggests that in the `input_variations` method, we're trying to transpose a string representation of the pattern instead of an array of rows. To fix this, we need to ensure that the pattern is properly split into an array of rows before attempting to transpose it.

Additionally, the error occurs in the `input_variations` method, which is likely responsible for generating all possible variations (rotations and flips) of a given pattern. We should review and correct this method to properly handle the input as an array of strings, each representing a row of the pattern.
