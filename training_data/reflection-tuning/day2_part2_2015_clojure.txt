To solve this problem efficiently in Clojure, we'll follow these steps:
1. Read the input file and parse each line into a list of dimensions.
2. Create helper functions to calculate wrapping paper and ribbon for each present.
3. Use map and reduce to apply these calculations to all presents and sum the results.
4. Print the total square feet of wrapping paper and total feet of ribbon.

The key to efficiency here is to use Clojure's built-in functions for data transformation and reduction, avoiding explicit loops and mutable state.
