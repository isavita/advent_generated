The error message indicates that we're trying to use the modulo operator (%) on a nil value in the registers hash. This suggests that we're trying to access a register that hasn't been initialized. To fix this, we should ensure that both registers 'a' and 'b' are initialized to 0 at the start of the program. Additionally, we should add error handling to catch cases where an undefined register is accessed.

Another potential issue is that the error occurs in the 'jie' instruction handling. We should make sure that this instruction, along with 'jio', are correctly implemented according to the problem description.
