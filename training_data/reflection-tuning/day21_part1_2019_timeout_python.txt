The error message indicates a SyntaxError on the line containing `set_param(modes[0], a, yield)`. The issue here is that `yield` is a reserved keyword in Python, used for generator functions. It cannot be used as a variable name or parameter. The programmer likely intended to use a different variable name here, possibly something like `result` or `output`. To fix this, we need to replace `yield` with an appropriate variable name throughout the code.
