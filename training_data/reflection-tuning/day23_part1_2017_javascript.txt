To solve this problem, we need to simulate the execution of the given instructions. Here's the approach:

1. Read the input file and parse each line into an instruction.
2. Initialize all registers (a through h) to 0.
3. Create a counter for the number of times the 'mul' instruction is invoked.
4. Implement a function to execute each type of instruction.
5. Iterate through the instructions, executing them and updating the registers accordingly.
6. Keep track of the program counter to handle jumps.
7. Count the 'mul' instructions as they are executed.
8. Print the final count of 'mul' instructions.

The key to efficiency here is to use a simple object to represent the registers and a switch statement to handle different instruction types quickly.
