Based on the given output, it seems that Part 1 was solved correctly (937 viable pairs), but Part 2 is likely incorrect. The issue in Part 2 is probably related to the pathfinding algorithm or the way we're counting steps to move the goal data.

For Part 2, we need to implement a more sophisticated approach:
1. Identify the goal data location (top-right corner)
2. Find the empty node
3. Implement a pathfinding algorithm (like A* or BFS) to move the empty node adjacent to the goal data
4. Move the goal data towards the target (0,0) position, shifting the empty space accordingly

The previous solution might have oversimplified this process or missed some crucial steps. Let's implement a more robust solution that takes into account the grid structure and the specific requirements of moving data.
