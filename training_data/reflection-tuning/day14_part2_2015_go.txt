To solve this problem efficiently, we need to:
1. Parse the input file to extract reindeer data.
2. Implement a function to calculate the distance traveled by each reindeer after 2503 seconds.
3. Implement a function to simulate the race second by second, awarding points to the leading reindeer(s).
4. Keep track of the maximum distance traveled (for Part 1) and the maximum points scored (for Part 2).

We'll use structs to represent reindeer data and a slice to store all reindeer. We'll then iterate through the race duration, updating distances and points accordingly.
