The error message indicates that there's an issue with loading a file called "algorithms". This suggests that the previous solution might have been trying to use an external library or module that isn't available in the current environment. To fix this, we should avoid using external libraries and implement the solution using only Ruby's standard library.

For this problem, we need to implement a pathfinding algorithm, likely A* or Dijkstra's algorithm, to find the least energy path to organize the amphipods. We'll need to represent the burrow state, implement the movement rules, and calculate the energy cost for each move.

Let's create a solution that doesn't rely on external libraries and implements the necessary algorithms from scratch.
