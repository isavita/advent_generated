The error message indicates a deadlock, which typically occurs when all goroutines are blocked waiting for something that will never happen. In this case, it's likely that the program is trying to send data on a channel that no one is receiving from, or trying to receive from a channel that no one is sending to.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that all channel operations are properly balanced. This might involve:

1. Making sure that for every send operation, there's a corresponding receive operation.
2. Using buffered channels if we want to allow sends without an immediate receive.
3. Ensuring that we're not accidentally blocking on a channel operation in the main goroutine.

Without seeing the full code, it's hard to pinpoint the exact issue. However, a common mistake is to send on a channel in the main goroutine without having started a goroutine to receive from it. Let's restructure the solution to avoid this potential pitfall by using buffered channels and ensuring all channel operations are balanced.
