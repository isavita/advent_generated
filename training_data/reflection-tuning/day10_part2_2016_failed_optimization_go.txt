The timeout error suggests that the previous solution was likely inefficient, possibly due to an ineffective algorithm or unnecessary iterations. To address this, we should focus on optimizing the data structures and the processing logic. Here's how we can approach it:

1. Use maps for efficient lookups of bots and outputs.
2. Implement a queue system to process bots only when they have two chips.
3. Process instructions in a single pass, updating the state as we go.
4. Avoid recursive or nested loop structures that might cause excessive iterations.
5. Use a struct to represent bots and their states.
6. Implement early exit conditions when we find the bot comparing 61 and 17.

This approach should significantly reduce the execution time by eliminating unnecessary operations and optimizing data access.
