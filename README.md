# Advent of Code Solutions

This project gathers solutions for Advent of Code challenges implemented in many different programming languages. Most of the code here was created with the help of various large language models (LLMs).

## Overview

The repository contains a directory for each language, such as `python`, `rust`, `cpp`, `go`, and many others. Within these folders you'll find implementations of the Advent of Code puzzles. Some challenges have multiple versions showing how different LLMs approached the same problem.

## Purpose

This collection aims to:

1. Evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct and idiomatic solutions across a wide range of languages.
2. Provide example implementations that may be used as training data or references for future code generation experiments.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have new solutions or improvements to existing code, feel free to open a pull request.
