# This program solves the Day 19 challenge of Advent of Code 2021.
# It reads the input from "input.txt", which contains scanner reports,
# finds the positions of all scanners and beacons (by matching 12 overlapping beacons)
# and then prints:
#    * the total number of unique beacons (Part One)
#    * the largest Manhattan distance between any two scanners (Part Two)

Explanation:

1. The script first generates the 24 possible rotations in 3D using an algorithm that picks orthogonal unit vectors.
2. It parses the input, assuming each scannerâ€™s output is separated by a blank line and beacons are given as "x,y,z".
3. Scanner 0 is taken as the reference with position [0,0,0].
4. The script then iteratively aligns the other scanners by trying each rotation and computing a translation that causes at least 12 overlapping beacon points with those already placed.
5. Once aligned, it updates the global beacon set and stores each scanner's absolute position.
6. Finally, the script prints the number of unique beacons (Part One) and computes the largest Manhattan distance between any two scanner positions (Part Two).

To run this program, simply ensure your input is in a file called "input.txt" in the same directory and execute:

  perl this_script.pl

Enjoy!
